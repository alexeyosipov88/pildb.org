VALUES(25, 'CONVENTION ON CELEBRATION AND RECOGNITION OF THE VALIDITY OF MARRIAGES
(Concluded 14 March 1978)
 
The States signatory to the present Convention,
Desiring to facilitate the celebration of marriages and the recognition of the validity of marriages,
Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect, and have agreed on the following provisions -
 
chapter i - celebration of marriages
Article 1
This Chapter shall apply to the requirements in a Contracting State for celebration of marriages.
Article 2
The formal requirements for marriages shall be governed by the law of the State of celebration.
Article 3
A marriage shall be celebrated -
(1)  where the future spouses meet the substantive requirements of the internal law of the State of celebration and one of them has the nationality of that State or habitually resides there; or
(2)  where each of the future spouses meets the substantive requirements of the internal law designated by the choice of law rules of the State of celebration.
Article 4
The State of celebration may require the future spouses to furnish any necessary evidence as to the content of any foreign law which is applicable under the preceding Articles.
Article 5
The application of a foreign law declared applicable by this Chapter may be refused only if such application is manifestly incompatible with the public policy ("ordre public") of the State of celebration.
Article 6
A Contracting State may reserve the right, by way of derogation from Article 3, sub-paragraph 1, not to apply its internal law to the substantive requirements for marriage in respect of a future spouse who neither is a national of that State nor habitually resides there.
 
chapter ii - recognition of the validity of marriages
Article 7
This Chapter shall apply to the recognition in a Contracting State of the validity of marriages entered into in other States.
Article 8
This Chapter shall not apply to -
(1)  marriages celebrated by military authorities;
(2)  marriages celebrated aboard ships or aircraft;
(3)  proxy marriages;
(4)  posthumous marriages;
(5)  informal marriages.
Article 9
A marriage validly entered into under the law of the State of celebration or which subsequently becomes valid under that law shall be considered as such in all Contracting States, subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
A marriage celebrated by a diplomatic agent or consular official in accordance with his law shall similarly be considered valid in all Contracting States, provided that the celebration is not prohibited by the State of celebration.
Article 10
Where a marriage certificate has been issued by a competent authority, the marriage shall be presumed to be valid until the contrary is established.
Article 11
A Contracting State may refuse to recognise the validity of a marriage only where, at the time of the marriage, under the law of that State -
(1)  one of the spouses was already married; or
(2)  the spouses were related to one another, by blood or by adoption, in the direct line or as brother and sister; or
(3)  one of the spouses had not attained the minimum age required for marriage, nor had obtained the necessary dispensation; or
(4)  one of the spouses did not have the mental capacity to consent; or
(5)  one of the spouses did not freely consent to the marriage.
However, recognition may not be refused where, in the case mentioned in sub-paragraph 1 of the preceding paragraph, the marriage has subsequently become valid by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the prior marriage.
Article 12
The rules of this Chapter shall apply even where the recognition of the validity of a marriage is to be dealt with as an incidental question in the context of another question.
However, these rules need not be applied where that other question, under the choice of law rules of the forum, is governed by the law of a non-Contracting State.
Article 13
This Convention shall not prevent the application in a Contracting State of rules of law more favourable to the recognition of foreign marriages.
Article 14
A Contracting State may refuse to recognise the validity of a marriage where such recognition is manifestly incompatible with its public policy ("ordre public").
Article 15
This Chapter shall apply regardless of the date on which the marriage was celebrated.
However, a Contracting State may reserve the right not to apply this Chapter to a marriage celebrated before the date on which, in relation to that State, the Convention enters into force.
 
chapter iii - general clauses
Article 16
A Contracting State may reserve the right to exclude the application of Chapter I.
Article 17
Where a State has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply in relation to marriage, any reference to the law of the State of celebration shall be construed as referring to the law of the territorial unit in which the marriage is or was celebrated.
Article 18
Where a State has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply in relation to marriage, any reference to the law of that State in connection with the recognition of the validity of a marriage shall be construed as referring to the law of the territorial unit in which recognition is sought.
Article 19
Where a State has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply in relation to marriage, this Convention need not be applied to the recognition in one territorial unit of the validity of a marriage entered into in another territorial unit.
Article 20
Where a State has, in relation to marriage, two or more systems of law applicable to different categories of persons, any reference to the law of that State shall be construed as referring to the system of law designated by the rules in force in that State.
Article 21
The Convention shall not affect the application of any convention containing provisions on the celebration or recognition of the validity of marriages to which a Contracting State is a Party at the time this Convention enters into force for that State.
This Convention shall not affect the right of a Contracting State to become a Party to a convention, based on special ties of a regional or other nature, containing provisions on the celebration or recognition of validity of marriages.

Article 23
