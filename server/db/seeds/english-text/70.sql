Article 8
Unless the parties agree otherwise, the traveller may substitute another person for the purpose of carrying out the contract provided that such person satisfies the specific requirements relating to the journey or sojourn, and that the traveller compensates the travel organizer for any expenditure caused by such substitution, including non-reimbursable sums payable to third parties.
 
Article 9
The traveller may at any time cancel the contract in whole or in part, provided he compensates the organising travel agent in accordance with domestic law or the provisions of the contract.
 
Article 10
1. The travel organizer may, without indemnity, cancel the contract, in whole or in part, if before the contract or during its performance, circumstances of an exceptional character manifest themselves of which he could not have known at the time of conclusion of the contract, and which, had they been known to him at that time, would have given him valid reason not to conclude the contract.
2. The travel organizer may also, without indemnity, cancel the contract if the minimum number of travellers stipulated in the travel document has not been reached, provided the traveller has been informed thereof at least fifteen days before the date on which the journey or sojourn was due to begin.

Article 11
1. The travel organizer may not increase the inclusive price, except as a consequence of changes in rates of exchange or in the tariffs of carriers, and provided that this possibility has been anticipated in the travel document.

The travel organizer shall be liable in accordance with the same rules for any loss or damage caused to the traveller during the performance of the services, unless the travel organizer proves that he has acted as a diligent travel organizer in the choice of the person or persons performing the service.
2. Where the rules referred to in paragraph 1 do not provide for a limitation of liability, compensation payable by the travel organizer shall be set in accordance with Article 13, paragraph 2.
3. In so far as the travel organizer has paid compensation for loss or damage caused to the traveller, he shall be subrogated in any rights and actions the traveller may have against a third party responsible for such loss or damage.

ANNEX TO THE FINAL ACT OF THE DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE
ON THE TRAVEL CONTRACT
 
Resolution
The work completed, the Diplomatic Conference on the Travel Contract wishes to present its most sincere appreciation to the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) which prepared, following long and detailed studies, the draft International Convention on the Travel Agency Contract utilized as basic working paper at the Conference.
 
Recommendation no. 1
The Conference recommends that the Contracting States take appropriate measures in order to ensure that travel organizers and travel intermediaries be able to meet the financial obligations incumbent upon them under the Convention.
 
Recommendation no. 2
Each Contracting State is requested to help the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) in compiling, each year, a list in the English and French languages, of judicial and arbitral decisions of major importance relating to the interpretation and application of the International Convention on the Travel Contract. In this list, there shall be a short summary of the contents of each decision and a reference to the source where the decision is to be found. This material will be edited by UNIDROIT in a publication which will be sent to each Contracting State.
 
Recommendation no. 3
The Diplomatic Conference on the Travel Contract (CCV) meeting in Brussels in 1970,
Having noted that during the Convention drafting procedure, the insufficiency if not the total lack of uniform international rules governing the hotelkeepers'' liability was stressed,
Having taken into consideration the fact that the International Institute for Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) had already elaborated a draft uniform law on hotelkeepers'' liability, with respect to personal belongings brought by travellers, draft that was used as a basis for the European Convention in this field, the general elaboration of the uniform provisions on the hotelkeepers'' contract, appears in the UNIDROIT work programme,
Expresses the wish that the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), will undertake as soon as possible, the elaboration of uniform provisions relative to hotelkeepers'' contracts, to be subsequently submitted to the Governments for examination and eventual approval.
