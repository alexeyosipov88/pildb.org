VALUES(72, 'UNIDROIT CONVENTION ON
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL LEASING
(Ottawa, 28 May 1988)
 
THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,
RECOGNISING the importance of removing certain legal impediments to the international financial leasing of equipment, while maintaining a fair balance of interests between the different parties to the transaction,
AWARE of the need to make international financial leasing more available,
CONSCIOUS of the fact that the rules of law governing the traditional contract of hire need to be adapted to the distinctive triangular relationship created by the financial leasing transaction,
RECOGNISING therefore the desirability of formulating certain uniform rules relating primarily to the civil and commercial law aspects of international financial leasing,
HAVE AGREED as follows:
 
 
CHAPTER I - SPHERE OF APPLICATION AND
GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
Article 1
1. - This Convention governs a financial leasing transaction as described in paragraph 2 in which one party (the lessor),
(a) on the specifications of another party (the lessee), enters into an agreement (the supply agreement) with a third party (the supplier) under which the lessor acquires plant, capital goods or other equipment (the equipment) on terms approved by the lessee so far as they concern its interests, and
(b) enters into an agreement (the leasing agreement) with the lessee, granting to the lessee the right to use the equipment in return for the payment of rentals.
2. - The financial leasing transaction referred to in the previous paragraph is a transaction which includes the following characteristics:
(a) the lessee specifies the equipment and selects the supplier without relying primarily on the skill and judgment of the lessor;
(b) the equipment is acquired by the lessor in connection with a leasing agreement which, to the knowledge of the supplier, either has been made or is to be made between the lessor and the lessee; and
(c) the rentals payable under the leasing agreement are calculated so as to take into account in particular the amortisation of the whole or a substantial part of the cost of the equipment.
3. - This Convention applies whether or not the lessee has or subsequently acquires the option to buy the equipment or to hold it on lease for a further period, and whether or not for a nominal price or rental.
4. - This Convention applies to financial leasing transactions in relation to all equipment save that which is to be used primarily for the lessee''s personal, family or household purposes.
 
Article 2
In the case of one or more sub-leasing transactions involving the same equipment, this Convention applies to each transaction which is a financial leasing transaction and is otherwise subject to this Convention as if the person from whom the first lessor (as defined in paragraph 1 of the previous article) acquired the equipment were the supplier and as if the agreement under which the equipment was so acquired were the supply agreement.
 
Article 3
1. - This Convention applies when the lessor and the lessee have their places of business in different States and:
(a) those States and the State in which the supplier has its place of business are Contracting States; or
(b) both the supply agreement and the leasing agreement are governed by the law of a Contracting State.
2. - A reference in this Convention to a party''s place of business shall, if it has more than one place of business, mean the place of business which has the closest relationship to the relevant agreement and its performance, having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of that agreement.
 
Article 4
1. - The provisions of this Convention shall not cease to apply merely because the equipment has become a fixture to or incorporated in land.
2. - Any question whether or not the equipment has become a fixture to or incorporated in land, and if so the effect on the rights inter se of the lessor and a person having real rights in the land, shall be determined by the law of the State where the land is situated.
 
Article 5
1. - The application of this Convention may be excluded only if each of the parties to the supply agreement and each of the parties to the leasing agreement agree to exclude it.
2. - Where the application of this Convention has not been excluded in accordance with the previous paragraph, the parties may, in their relations with each other, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions except as stated in Articles 8(3) and 13(3)(b) and (4).
 
Article 6
1. - In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its object and purpose as set forth in the preamble, to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international trade.
2. - Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.
 
 
CHAPTER II - RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES
 
Article 7
1. - (a) The lessor''s real rights in the equipment shall be valid against the lessee''s trustee in bankruptcy and creditors, including creditors who have obtained an attachment or execution.
(b) For the purposes of this paragraph "trustee in bankruptcy" includes a liquidator, administrator or other person appointed to administer the lessee''s estate for the benefit of the general body of creditors.
2. - Where by the applicable law the lessor''s real rights in the equipment are valid against a person referred to in the previous paragraph only on compliance with rules as to public notice, those rights shall be valid against that person only if there has been compliance with such rules.
3. - For the purposes of the previous paragraph the applicable law is the law of the State which, at the time when a person referred to in paragraph 1 becomes entitled to invoke the rules referred to in the previous paragraph, is :
(a) in the case of a registered ship, the State in which it is registered in the name of the owner (for the purposes of this sub-paragraph a bareboat charterer is deemed not to be the owner);
(b) in the case of an aircraft which is registered pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation done at Chicago on 7 December 1944, the State in which it is so registered;
(c) in the case of other equipment of a kind normally moved from one State to another, including an aircraft engine, the State in which the lessee has its principal place of business;
(d) in the case of all other equipment, the State in which the equipment is situated.
4. - Paragraph 2 shall not affect the provisions of any other treaty under which the lessor''s real rights in the equipment are required to be recognised.
5. - This article shall not affect the priority of any creditor having:
(a) a consensual or non-consensual lien or security interest in the equipment arising otherwise than by virtue of an attachment or execution, or
(b) any right of arrest, detention or disposition conferred specifically in relation to ships or aircraft under the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.
 
Article 8
1. - (a) Except as otherwise provided by this Convention or stated in the leasing agreement, the lessor shall not incur any liability to the lessee in respect of the equipment save to the extent that the lessee has suffered loss as the result of its reliance on the lessor''s skill and judgment and of the lessor''s intervention in the selection of the supplier or the specifications of the equipment.
(b) The lessor shall not, in its capacity of lessor, be liable to third parties for death, personal injury or damage to property caused by the equipment.
(c) The above provisions of this paragraph shall not govern any liability of the lessor in any other capacity, for example as owner.
2. - The lessor warrants that the lessee''s quiet possession will not be disturbed by a person who has a superior title or right, or who claims a superior title or right and acts under the authority of a court, where such title, right or claim is not derived from an act or omission of the lessee.
3. - The parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of the provisions of the previous paragraph in so far as the superior title, right or claim is derived from an intentional or grossly negligent act or omission of the lessor.
4. - The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not affect any broader warranty of quiet possession by the lessor which is mandatory under the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.
 
Article 9
1. - The lessee shall take proper care of the equipment, use it in a reasonable manner and keep it in the condition in which it was delivered, subject to fair wear and tear and to any modification of the equipment agreed by the parties.
2. - When the leasing agreement comes to an end the lessee, unless exercising a right to buy the equipment or to hold the equipment on lease for a further period, shall return the equipment to the lessor in the condition specified in the previous paragraph.
 
Article 10
1. - The duties of the supplier under the supply agreement shall also be owed to the lessee as if it were a party to that agreement and as if the equipment were to be supplied directly to the lessee. However, the supplier shall not be liable to both the lessor and the lessee in respect of the same damage.
2. - Nothing in this article shall entitle the lessee to terminate or rescind the supply agreement without the consent of the lessor.
 
Article 11
The lessee''s rights derived from the supply agreement under this Convention shall not be affected by a variation of any term of the supply agreement previously approved by the lessee unless it consented to that variation.
 
Article 12
1. - Where the equipment is not delivered or is delivered late or fails to conform to the supply agreement:
(a) the lessee has the right as against the lessor to reject the equipment or to terminate the leasing agreement; and
(b) the lessor has the right to remedy its failure to tender equipment in conformity with the supply agreement, as if the lessee had agreed to buy the equipment from the lessor under the same terms as those of the supply agreement.
2. - A right conferred by the previous paragraph shall be exercisable in the same manner and shall be lost in the same circumstances as if the lessee had agreed to buy the equipment from the lessor under the same terms as those of the supply agreement.
3. - The lessee shall be entitled to withhold rentals payable under the leasing agreement until the lessor has remedied its failure to tender equipment in conformity with the supply agreement or the lessee has lost the right to reject the equipment.
4. - Where the lessee has exercised a right to terminate the leasing agreement, the lessee shall be entitled to recover any rentals and other sums paid in advance, less a reasonable sum for any benefit the lessee has derived from the equipment.
5. - The lessee shall have no other claim against the lessor for non-delivery, delay in delivery or delivery of non-conforming equipment except to the extent to which this results from the act or omission of the lessor.
6. - Nothing in this article shall affect the lessee''s rights against the supplier under Article 10.
 
Article 13
1. - In the event of default by the lessee, the lessor may recover accrued unpaid rentals, together with interest and damages.
2. - Where the lessee''s default is substantial, then subject to paragraph 5 the lessor may also require accelerated payment of the value of the future rentals, where the leasing agreement so provides, or may terminate the leasing agreement and after such termination:
(a) recover possession of the equipment; and
(b) recover such damages as will place the lessor in the position in which it would have been had the lessee performed the leasing agreement in accordance with its terms.
3. - (a) The leasing agreement may provide for the manner in which the damages recoverable under paragraph 2 (b) are to be computed.
(b) Such provision shall be enforceable between the parties unless it would result in damages substantially in excess of those provided for under paragraph 2 (b). The parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of the provisions of the present sub-paragraph.
4. - Where the lessor has terminated the leasing agreement, it shall not be entitled to enforce a term of that agreement providing for acceleration of payment of future rentals, but the value of such rentals may be taken into account in computing damages under paragraphs 2(b) and 3. The parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of the provisions of the present paragraph.
5. - The lessor shall not be entitled to exercise its right of acceleration or its right of termination under paragraph 2 unless it has by notice given the lessee a reasonable opportunity of remedying the default so far as the same may be remedied.
6. - The lessor shall not be entitled to recover damages to the extent that it has failed to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss.
 
Article 14
1. - The lessor may transfer or otherwise deal with all or any of its rights in the equipment or under the leasing agreement. Such a transfer shall not relieve the lessor of any of its duties under the leasing agreement or alter either the nature of the leasing agreement or its legal treatment as provided in this Convention.
2. - The lessee may transfer the right to the use of the equipment or any other rights under the leasing agreement only with the consent of the lessor and subject to the rights of third parties.
