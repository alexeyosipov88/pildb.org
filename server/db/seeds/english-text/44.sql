-------------------------------
(1) This Convention applies to an international undertaking referred to in
article 2:
(a) If the place of business of the guarantor/issuer at which the undertaking
is issued is in a Contracting State, or
(b) If the rules of private international law lead to the application of the
law of a Contracting State,
unless the undertaking excludes the application of the Convention.
(2) This Convention applies also to an international letter of credit not
falling within article 2 if it expressly states that it is subject to this
Convention.
(3) The provisions of articles 21 and 22 apply to international undertakings
referred to in article 2 independently of paragraph (1) of this article.
ARTICLE 2. UNDERTAKING
----------------------
(1) For the purposes of this Convention, an undertaking is an independent
commitment, known in international practice as an independent guarantee or as a
stand-by letter of credit, given by a bank or other institution or person
("guarantor/issuer") to pay to the beneficiary a certain or determinable amount
upon simple demand or upon demand accompanied by other documents, in conformity
with the terms and any documentary conditions of the undertaking, indicating,
or from which it is to be inferred, that payment is due because of a default in
the performance of an obligation, or because of another contingency, or for
money borrowed or advanced, or on account of any mature indebtedness undertaken
by the principal/applicant or another person.
(2) The undertaking may be given:
(a) At the request or on the instruction of the customer
("principal/applicant") of the guarantor/ issuer;
(b) On the instruction of another bank, institution or person ("instructing
party") that acts at the request of the customer ("principal/applicant") of
that instructing party; or
(c) On behalf of the guarantor/issuer itself.
(3) Payment may be stipulated in the undertaking to be made in any form,
including:
(a) Payment in a specified currency or unit of account;
(b) Acceptance of a bill of exchange (draft);
(c) Payment on a deferred basis;
(d) Supply of a specified item of value.
(4) The undertaking may stipulate that the guarantor/issuer itself is the
beneficiary when acting in favour of another person.
ARTICLE 3. INDEPENDENCE OF UNDERTAKING
--------------------------------------
For the purposes of this Convention, an undertaking is independent where the
guarantor/issuer''s obligation to the beneficiary is not:
(a) Dependent upon the existence or validity of any underlying transaction, or
upon any other undertaking (including stand-by letters of credit or independent
guarantees to which confirmations or counter-guarantees relate); or
(b) Subject to any term or condition not appearing in the undertaking, or to
any future, uncertain act or event except presentation of documents or another
such act or event within a guarantor/ issuer''s sphere of operations.
ARTICLE 4. INTERNATIONALITY OF UNDERTAKING
------------------------------------------
(1) An undertaking is international if the places of business, as specified in
the undertaking, of any two of the following persons are in different States:
guarantor/issuer, beneficiary, principal/applicant, instructing party,
confirmer.
(2) For the purposes of the preceding paragraph:
(a) If the undertaking lists more than one place of business for a given
person, the relevant place of business is that which has the closest
relationship to the undertaking;
(b) If the undertaking does not specify a place of business for a given person
but specifies its habitual residence, that residence is relevant for
determining the international character of the undertaking.
CHAPTER II. INTERPRETATION

CHAPTER III. FORM AND CONTENT OF UNDERTAKING

-----------------------------------------------------------
(1) Issuance of an undertaking occurs when and where the undertaking leaves the
sphere of control of the guarantor/issuer concerned.
(2) An undertaking may be issued in any form which preserves a complete record
of the text of the undertaking and provides authentication of its source by
generally accepted means or by a procedure agreed upon by the guarantor/issuer
and the beneficiary.
(3) From the time of issuance of an undertaking, a demand for payment may be
made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the undertaking, unless the
undertaking stipulates a different time.
(4) An undertaking is irrevocable upon issuance, unless it stipulates that it

undertaking or, failing such stipulation, in a form referred to in paragraph
(2) of article 7.
(2) Unless otherwise stipulated in the undertaking or elsewhere agreed by the
guarantor/issuer and the beneficiary, an undertaking is amended upon issuance
of the amendment if the amendment has previously been authorized by the
beneficiary.
(3) Unless otherwise stipulated in the undertaking or elsewhere agreed by the
guarantor/issuer and the beneficiary, where any amendment has not previously
been authorized by the beneficiary, the undertaking is amended only when the
guarantor/issuer receives a notice of acceptance of the amendment by the
beneficiary in a form referred to in paragraph (2) of article 7.
(4) An amendment of an undertaking has no effect on the rights and obligations
of the principal/ applicant (or an instructing party) or of a confirmer of the

ARTICLE 9. TRANSFER OF BENEFICIARY''S RIGHT TO DEMAND PAYMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The beneficiary''s right to demand payment may be transferred only if

undertaking.
(2) If the guarantor/issuer or another person obliged to effect payment has
received a notice originating from the beneficiary, in a form referred to in
paragraph (2) of article 7, of the beneficiary''s irrevocable assignment,
payment to the assignee discharges the obligor, to the extent of its payment,
from its liability under the undertaking.
ARTICLE 11. CESSATION OF RIGHT TO DEMAND PAYMENT

when:
(a) The guarantor/issuer has received a statement by the beneficiary of release
from liability in a form referred to in paragraph (2) of article 7;
(b) The beneficiary and the guarantor/issuer have agreed on the termination of
the undertaking in the form stipulated in the undertaking or, failing such
stipulation, in a form referred to in paragraph (2) of article 7;

undertaking provides for the automatic renewal or for an automatic increase of
the amount available or otherwise provides for continuation of the undertaking;
(d) The validity period of the undertaking expires in accordance with the
provisions of article 12.
(2) The undertaking may stipulate, or the guarantor/issuer and the beneficiary
may agree elsewhere, that return of the document embodying the undertaking to
the guarantor/issuer, or a procedure functionally equivalent to the return of
the document in the case of the issuance of the undertaking in non-paper form,
is required for the cessation of the right to demand payment, either alone or
in conjunction with one of the events referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b)
of paragraph (1) of this article. However, in no case shall retention of any
such document by the beneficiary after the right to demand payment ceases in
accordance with subparagraph (c) or (d) of paragraph (1) of this article
preserve any rights of the beneficiary under the undertaking.

of a fixed period of time stipulated in the undertaking, provided that, if the

guarantor/issuer at which the undertaking is issued, or of another person or at
another place stipulated in the undertaking for presentation of the demand for
payment, expiry occurs on the first business day which follows;
(b) If expiry depends according to the undertaking on the occurrence of an act
or event not within the guarantor/issuer''s sphere of operations, when the
guarantor/issuer is advised that the act or event has occurred by presentation
of the document specified for that purpose in the undertaking or, if no such
document is specified, of a certification by the beneficiary of the occurrence
of the act or event;
(c) If the undertaking does not state an expiry date, or if the act or event on
which expiry is stated to depend has not yet been established by presentation
of the required document and an expiry date has not been stated in addition,
when six years have elapsed from the date of issuance of the undertaking.
CHAPTER IV. RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND DEFENCES
============================================
ARTICLE 13. DETERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
---------------------------------------------------

arising from the undertaking are determined by the terms and conditions set
forth in the undertaking, including any rules, general conditions or usages
specifically referred to therein, and by the provisions of this Convention.
(2) In interpreting terms and conditions of the undertaking and in settling
questions that are not addressed by the terms and conditions of the undertaking
or by the provisions of this Convention, regard shall be had to generally
accepted international rules and usages of independent guarantee or stand-by
letter of credit practice.
ARTICLE 14. STANDARD OF CONDUCT AND LIABILITY OF GUARANTOR/ISSUER
-----------------------------------------------------------------

the guarantor/issuer shall act in good faith and exercise reasonable care
having due regard to generally accepted standards of international practice of
independent guarantees or stand-by letters of credit.
(2) A guarantor/issuer may not be exempted from liability for its failure to
act in good faith or for any grossly negligent conduct.
ARTICLE 15. DEMAND
------------------
(1) Any demand for payment under the undertaking shall be made in a form
referred to in paragraph (2) of article 7 and in conformity with the terms and
conditions of the undertaking.

certification or other document required by the undertaking shall be presented,
within the time that a demand for payment may be made, to the guarantor/issuer
at the place where the undertaking was issued.
(3) The beneficiary, when demanding payment, is deemed to certify that the
demand is not in bad faith and that none of the elements referred to in
subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph (1) of article 19 are present.
ARTICLE 16. EXAMINATION OF DEMAND AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The guarantor/issuer shall examine the demand and any accompanying
documents in accordance with the standard of conduct referred to in paragraph
(1) of article 14. In determining whether documents are in facial conformity
with the terms and conditions of the undertaking, and are consistent with one
another, the guarantor/issuer shall have due regard to the applicable
international standard of independent guarantee or stand-by letter of credit
practice.
(2) Unless otherwise stipulated in the undertaking or elsewhere agreed by the
guarantor/issuer and the beneficiary, the guarantor/issuer shall have
reasonable time, but not more than seven business days following the day of
receipt of the demand and any accompanying documents, in which to:
(a) Examine the demand and any accompanying documents;
(b) Decide whether or not to pay;
(c) If the decision is not to pay, issue notice thereof to the beneficiary.
The notice referred to in subparagraph (c) above shall, unless otherwise
stipulated in the undertaking or elsewhere agreed by the guarantor/issuer and

other expeditious means and indicate the reason for the decision not to pay.
ARTICLE 17. PAYMENT
-------------------
(1) Subject to article 19, the guarantor/issuer shall pay against a demand made
in accordance with the provisions of article 15. Following a determination that
a demand for payment so conforms, payment shall be made promptly, unless the
undertaking stipulates payment on a deferred basis, in which case payment shall
be made at the stipulated time.
(2) Any payment against a demand that is not in accordance with the provisions
of article 15 does not prejudice the rights of the principal/applicant.
ARTICLE 18. SET-OFF
-------------------
Unless otherwise stipulated in the undertaking or elsewhere agreed by the
guarantor/issuer and the beneficiary, the guarantor/issuer may discharge the
payment obligation under the undertaking by availing itself of a right of
set-off, except with any claim assigned to it by the principal/applicant or the
instructing party.
ARTICLE 19. EXCEPTION TO PAYMENT OBLIGATION
-------------------------------------------
(1) If it is manifest and clear that:
(a) Any document is not genuine or has been falsified;
(b) No payment is due on the basis asserted in the demand and the supporting
documents; or
(c) Judging by the type and purpose of the undertaking, the demand has no
conceivable basis, the guarantor/issuer, acting in good faith, has a right, as
against the beneficiary, to withhold payment.
(2) For the purposes of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of this article, the
following are types of situations in which a demand has no conceivable basis:
(a) The contingency or risk against which the undertaking was designed to
secure the beneficiary has undoubtedly not materialized;
(b) The underlying obligation of the principal/applicant has been declared
invalid by a court or arbitral tribunal, unless the undertaking indicates that
such contingency falls within the risk to be covered by the undertaking;
(c) The underlying obligation has undoubtedly been fulfilled to the
satisfaction of the beneficiary;
(d) Fulfilment of the underlying obligation has clearly been prevented by
wilful misconduct of the beneficiary;
(e) In the case of a demand under a counter-guarantee, the beneficiary of the
counter-guarantee has made payment in bad faith as guarantor/issuer of the
undertaking to which the counter- guarantee relates.
(3) In the circumstances set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph
(1) of this article, the principal/applicant is entitled to provisional court
measures in accordance with article 20.
CHAPTER V. PROVISIONAL COURT MEASURES
=====================================
ARTICLE 20. PROVISIONAL COURT MEASURES
--------------------------------------
(1) Where, on an application by the principal/applicant or the instructing
party, it is shown that there is a high probability that, with regard to a
demand made, or expected to be made, by the beneficiary, one of the
circumstances referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph (1) of
article 19 is present, the court, on the basis of immediately available strong
evidence, may:
(a) Issue a provisional order to the effect that the beneficiary does not
receive payment, including an order that the guarantor/issuer hold the amount
of the undertaking, or
(b) Issue a provisional order to the effect that the proceeds of the
undertaking paid to the beneficiary are blocked, taking into account whether in
the absence of such an order the principal/ applicant would be likely to suffer
serious harm.
(2) The court, when issuing a provisional order referred to in paragraph (1) of
this article, may require the person applying therefor to furnish such form of
security as the court deems appropriate.
(3) The court may not issue a provisional order of the kind referred to in
paragraph (1) of this article based on any objection to payment other than
those referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph (1) of article
19, or use of the undertaking for a criminal purpose.
CHAPTER VI. CONFLICT OF LAWS
