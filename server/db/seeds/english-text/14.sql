VALUES(14, 'The States signatory to the present Convention,
Desiring to establish common provisions on the validity and effects of agreements on the choice of court,
Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions:
 
Article 1
In the matters to which this Convention applies and subject to the conditions which it prescribes, parties may by an agreement on the choice of court designate, for the purpose of deciding disputes which have arisen or may arise between them in connection with a specific legal relationship, either -
(1)      the courts of one of the Contracting States, the particular competent court being then determined (if at all) by the internal legal system or systems of that State, or
(2)      a court expressly named of one of the Contracting States, provided always that this court is competent according to the internal legal system or systems of that State.
Article 2
This Convention shall apply to agreements on the choice of court concluded in civil or commercial matters in situations having an international character.
It shall not apply to agreements on the choice of court concluded in the following matters -
(1) the status or capacity of persons or questions of family law including the personal or financial rights or obligations between parents and children or between spouses;
(2) maintenance obligations not included in sub-paragraph (1);
(3) questions of succession;
(4) questions of bankruptcy, compositions or analogous proceedings, including decisions which may result therefrom and which relate to the validity of the acts of the debtor;
(5) rights in immovable property.
Article 3
This Convention shall apply whatever the nationality of the parties.
Article 4
For the purpose of this Convention the agreement on the choice of court shall have been validly made if it is the result of the acceptance by one party of a written proposal by the other party expressly designating the chosen court or courts.
The existence of such an agreement shall not be presumed from the mere failure of a party to appear in an action brought against him in the chosen court.
The agreement on the choice of court shall be void or voidable if it has been obtained by an abuse of economic power or other unfair means.
Article 5
Unless the parties have otherwise agreed only the chosen court or courts shall have jurisdiction.
The chosen court shall be free to decline jurisdiction if it has proof that a court of another Contracting State could avail itself of the provisions of Article 6(2).
Article 6
Every court other than the chosen court or courts shall decline jurisdiction except -
(1) where the choice of court made by the parties is not exclusive,
(2) where under the internal law of the State of the excluded court, the parties were unable, because of the subject-matter, to agree to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of that State,
(3) where the agreement on the choice of court is void or voidable in the sense of Article 4,
(4) for the purpose of provisional or protective measures.
Article 7
Where, in their agreement, the parties have designated a court or the courts of a Contracting State without excluding the jurisdiction of other courts, proceedings already pending in any court thus having jurisdiction and which may result in a decision capable of being recognised in the State where the defence is pleaded, shall constitute the basis for the defence of lis pendens.
Article 8
Decisions given by a chosen court in the sense of this Convention in one of the Contracting States shall be recognised and enforced in the other Contracting States in accordance with the rules for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in force in those States.
Article 9
Where the conditions for recognition and enforcement of a decision rendered on the basis of an agreement on the choice of court are not fulfilled in another Contracting State, the agreement shall not preclude any party from bringing a new action in the courts of that State.
Article 10
Settlements made in the chosen court in the course of proceedings there pending which are enforceable in the State of that court shall be treated in the same manner as decisions made by that court.
Article 11
This Convention shall not derogate from Conventions containing provisions on the matters governed by this Convention to which the Contracting States are, or shall become, Parties.
Article 12
Any Contracting State may reserve the right not to recognise agreements on the choice of court concluded between persons who, at the time of the conclusion of such agreements, were its nationals and had their habitual residence in its territory.
Article 13
Any Contracting State may make a reservation according to the terms of which it will treat as an internal matter the juridical relations established in its territory between, on the one hand, physical or juridical persons who are there and, on the other hand, establishments registered on local registers, even if such establishments are branches, agencies or other representatives of foreign firms in the territory in question.
Article 14
Any Contracting State may make a reservation according to the terms of which it may extend its exclusive jurisdiction to the juridical relations established in its territory between, on the one hand, physical or juridical persons who are there and on the other hand establishments registered on local registers, even if such establishments are branches, agencies or other representatives of foreign firms in the territory in question.
Article 15
Any Contracting State may reserve the right not to recognise agreements on the choice of court if the dispute has no connection with the chosen court, or if, in the circumstances, it would be seriously inconvenient for the matter to be dealt with by the chosen court.
