UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN
INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS
******************************************************************************

/ [PREAMBLE] /
--------------

/The States Parties to this Convention,/

/Reaffirming/ their belief that international trade on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit is an important element in promoting friendly relations
among States,

/Noting/ that the increased use of electronic communications improves the
efficiency of commercial activities, enhances trade connections and allows new
access opportunities for previously remote parties and markets, thus playing a
fundamental role in promoting trade and economic development, both domestically
and internationally,

/Considering/ that problems created by uncertainty as to the legal value of the
use of electronic communications in international contracts constitute an
obstacle to international trade,

/Convinced/ that the adoption of uniform rules to remove obstacles to the use
of electronic communications in international contracts, including obstacles
that might result from the operation of existing international trade law
instruments, would enhance legal certainty and commercial predictability for
international contracts and help States gain access to modern trade routes,

/Being of the opinion/ that uniform rules should respect the freedom of parties
to choose appropriate media and technologies, taking account of the principles
of technological neutrality and functional equivalence, to the extent that the
means chosen by the parties comply with the purpose of the relevant rules of
law,

/Desiring/ to provide a common solution to remove legal obstacles to the use of
electronic communications in a manner acceptable to States with different
legal, social and economic systems,

/Have agreed/ as follows:

is to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the
contract or from any dealings between the parties or from information disclosed
by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract.

3. Neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character
of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in
determining the application of this Convention.

The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or derogate from or
vary the effect of any of its provisions.

CHAPTER II - GENERAL PROVISIONS
===============================

ARTICLE 4 - DEFINITIONS
-----------------------

For the purposes of this Convention:

(a) "Communication" means any statement, declaration, demand, notice or
request, including an offer and the acceptance of an offer, that the parties
are required to make or choose to make in connection with the formation of or
performance of a contract;

(b) "Electronic communication" means any communication that the party make by

electronic, magnetic, optical or similar means, including, but not limited to,
electronic data interchange, electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy;

(d) "Originator" of an electronic communication means a party by whom, or on
whose behalf, the electronic communication has been sent or generated prior to
storage, if any, but it does not include a party acting as an intermediary with
respect to that electronic communication;

(e) "Addressee" of an electronic communication means a party who is intended by
the originator to receive the electronic communication, but does not include a
party acting as an intermediary with respect to that electronic communication;

(f) "Information system" means a system for generating, sending, receiving,
storing or otherwise processing data messages;

(g) "Automated message system" means a computer program or an electronic or

person each time an action is initiated or a response is generated by the
system;

(h) "Place of business" means any place where a party maintains a
non-transitory establishment to pursue an economic activity other than the
temporary provision of goods or services out of a specific location.

ARTICLE 5 - INTERPRETATION
--------------------------

1. In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its
international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its
application and the observance of good faith in international trade.

2. Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not
expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general
principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in
conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private
international law.

ARTICLE 6 - LOCATION OF THE PARTIES
-----------------------------------

1. For the purposes of this Convention, a party's place of business is presumed
to be the location indicated by that party, unless another party demonstrates
that the party making the indication does not have a place of business at that
location.

2. If a party has not indicated a place of business and has more than one place
of business, then the place of business for the purposes of this Convention is
that which has the closest relationship to the relevant contract, having regard
to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before
the conclusion of the contract.

3. If a natural person does not have a place of business, reference is to be
made to the person's habitual residence.

4. A location is not a place of business merely because that is: (a) where
equipment and technology supporting an information system used by a party in
connection with the formation of a contract are located; or (b) where the
information system may be accessed by other parties.

5. The sole fact that a party makes use of a domain name or electronic mail
address connected to a specific country does not create a presumption that its
place of business is located in that country.

ARTICLE 7 - INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------

Nothing in this Convention affects the application of any rule of law that may
require the parties to disclose their identities, place of business or other
information, or relieves a party from the legal consequences of making
inaccurate, incomplete or false statements in that regard.

CHAPTER III - USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS
=========================================================================

ARTICLE 8 - LEGAL RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------

1. A communication or a contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability
on the sole ground that it is in the form of an electronic communication.

2. Nothing in this Convention requires a party to use or accept electronic
communications, but a party's general agreement to do so may be inferred from
the party's conduct.

ARTICLE 9 - FORM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------

1. Nothing in this Convention requires a communication or a contract to be made
or evidenced in any particular form.

2. Where the law requires that a communication or a contract should be in
writing, or provides consequences for the absence of writing, that requirement
is met by an electronic communication if the information contained therein is
accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.

3. Where the law requires a communication or a contract should be signed by a
party, or provides consequences for the absence of a signature, that
requirement is met in relation to an electronic communication if:

(a) A method is used to identify the party and to indicate that party's
intention in respect of the information contained in the electronic
communication; and

(b) The method used is either:

(i) As reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic
communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the
circumstances, including any equivalent agreement; or

(ii) Proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in subparagraph
(a) above, by itself or together with further evidence.

4. Where the law requires that a communication or a contract should be made
available or retained in its original form, or provides consequences for the
absence of an original, that requirement is met in relation to an electronic
communication if:

(a) There exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information in
contains from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as an
electronic communication or otherwise; and

(b) Where it is required that the information it contains be made available,
that information is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to
be made available.

5. For the purposes of paragraph 4 (a):

(a) The criteria for assessing integrity shall be whether the information has
remained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement and
any change that arises in the normal course of communication, storage and
display; and

(b) The standard of reliability required shall be assessed in the light of the
purpose for which the information was generated and in the light of all the
relevant circumstances.

ARTICLE 10 - TIME AND PLACE OF DISPATCH AND RECEIPT OF ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The time of dispatch of an electronic communication is the time when it
leaves an information system under the control of the originator or of the
party who sent it on behalf of the originator or, if the electronic
communication has not left an information system under the control of the
originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator, the time
when the electronic communication is received.

2. The time of receipt of an electronic communication is the time when it
becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at an electronic address
designated by the addressee. The time of receipt of an electronic communication
at another electronic address of the addressee is the time when it becomes
capable of being retrieved by the addressee at that address and the addressee
becomes aware that the electronic communication has been sent to that address.
An electronic communication is presumed to be capable of being retrieved by the
addressee when it reaches the addressee's electronic address.

3. An electronic communication is deemed to be dispatched at the place where
the originator has its place of business and is deemed to be received at the
place where the addressee has its place of business, as determined in
accordance with article 6.

4. Paragraph 2 of this article applies notwithstanding that the place where the
information system supporting an electronic address is located may be different
from the place where the electronic communication is deemed to be received
under paragraph 3 of the article.

ARTICLE 11 - INVITATION TO MAKE OFFERS
--------------------------------------

A proposal to conclude a contract made through one or more electronic
communications which is not addressed to one or more specific parties, but is
generally accessible to parties making use of information systems, including
proposals that make use of interactive applications for the placement of orders
through such information systems, is to be considered as an invitation to make
offers, unless it clearly indicates the intention of the party making the
proposal to be bound in case of acceptance.

ARTICLE 12 - USE OF AUTOMATED MESSAGE SYSTEMS FOR CONTRACT FORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and a
natural person, or by the interaction of automated message systems, shall not
be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural person
reviewed or intervened in each of the individual actions carried out by the
automated message systems or the resulting contract.

ARTICLE 13 - AVAILABILITY OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS
----------------------------------------------

Nothing in this Convention affects the application of any rule of law that may
require a party that negotiates some or all of the terms of a contract through
the exchange of electronic communications to make available to the other party
those electronic communications which contain the contractual terms in a
particular manner, or relieves a party from the legal consequences of failure
to do so.

ARTICLE 14 - ERROR IN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------

1. Where a natural person makes an input error in an electronic communication
exchanged with the automated message system of another party and the automated
message system does not provide the person with an opportunity to correct the
error, that person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has
the right to withdraw the portion of the electronic communication in which the
input error was made if:

(a) The person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, notifies
the other party of the error as soon as possible after having learned of the
error and indicates that he or she made an error in the electronic
communication; and

(b) The person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has not
used or received any material benefit or value from the goods or services, if
any, received from the other party.

2. Nothing in this article affects the application of any rule of law that may
govern the consequences of any error other than as provided for in paragraph 1.
