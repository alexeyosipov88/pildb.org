SCOPE OF APPLICATION
Article 1

This Convention shall apply to every contract for the carriage of passengers, and, where
appropriate, of their luggage in vehicles by road when the contract provides that the carriage shall take
place in the territory of more than one State and that the place of departure or the place of destination, or
both these places, shall be situated on the territory of a Contracting State, irrespective of the place of

carrier means any person who in the course of trade or business, but acting other than as
an operator of a taxi service or of a service hiring out vehicles with drivers, undertakes
under an individual or collective contract of carriage to carry one or more persons and,
where appropriate, their luggage, whether or not he performs the carriage himself;
passenger means any person who, in the performance of a contract of carriage made by
him or on his behalf, is carried either for reward or gratuitously by a carrier;
vehicle means any motor vehicle used in the performance of a contract of carriage and

agreements between two or more of them, except to make it inapplicable to their frontier traffic.

nevertheless apply to the portions of carriage which are performed by road, even if they are not
international within the meaning of article 1, provided that they are not ancillary to the other mode of
transport.
Article 3
Where the vehicle itself is carried over part of the journey by another mode of transport, this
Convention shall apply to loss or damage caused by an incident connected with the carriage by the
vehicle and which occurs either while the passenger is inside the vehicle or is entering or alighting from the
vehicle, or in connexion with the fact that luggage is on or in the vehicle or is being loaded or unloaded.

his agents and servants and of all other persons of whose services he makes use for the performance of
the obligations which are incumbent upon him by virtue of the contract of carriage by road when such
agents, servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their employment, as if such acts or
omissions were his own.
Chapter III

Chapter IV
LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER
Section 1. Personal Injuries
Article 11
1.
The carrier shall be liable for loss or damage resulting from the death or wounding of or from any
other doily or mental injury caused to a passenger as a result of an accident connected with the carriage
and occurring while the passenger is inside the vehicle or is entering or alighting from the vehicle, or
occurring in connexion with the loading or unloading of luggage.
2.
The carrier shall be relieved of this liability if the accident was caused by circumstances which a
carrier, using the diligence which the particular facts of the case called for, could not have avoided and
the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.
3.
The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of any physical or mental failing of the driver,
of any defect in, or malfunctioning of, the vehicle, or of any wrongful act or neglect on the part of the
person from whom he may have hired the vehicle or of the persons for whom the latter would have been
responsible, in accordance with the provisions of article 4, if he had himself been the carrier.
Article 12
Subject to article 13, paragraph 1, the court or tribunal seized of the case shall determine in
accordance with the national law of the place where the said court or tribunal is situated, including the
rules relating to conflict of laws, the extent of the injury giving rise to compensation as a result of the death
or wounding of or any other doily or mental injury caused to a passenger as well as what persons are
entitled to compensation for such injury.
Article 13
1.
The total damages payable by the carrier in respect of the same occurrence shall not exceed
250,000 francs for each victim. Any Contracting State may, however, set a higher limit or set no limit at
all. When the carrier has his principal establishment in such a State, or in a non-contracting State whose
legislation provides for a higher limit or does not provide for a limit at all, the law of that State, not
including the rules relating to conflict of laws, shall apply for the determination of the total amount.
2.
The amount referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be exclusive of legal or other costs
incurred by the parties in asserting their rights, payment or reimbursement of which may devolve on the
carrier, and of interest calculated in conformity with the law judged applicable by the court seized of the
case.
3.
A higher limit may be agreed between the parties to the contract of carriage. Unless the contract
provides otherwise, such agreement shall be for the benefit of all persons entitled to compensation.
- 4-
4.
The limitations of damages referred to in this article shall apply to all the claims arising out of the
death or wounding of or any other bodily or mental injury to a passenger. Where there is more than one
claimant and the total of their claims exceeds the limit established, the claims shall be reduced
proportionately.
Section 2. Damage to Luggage
Article 14
1.
The carrier shall be liable for loss or damage resulting from the total or partial loss of luggage and
for damage thereto.
The carrier shall be responsible for luggage handed to him from the time when he takes charge of it
until the time either of its delivery or of its deposit in accordance with article 10, paragraph 3.
The carrier shall be responsible for other luggage while it is in the vehicle but, if in circumstances
other than of an accident, the luggage is stolen or cannot be found, the carrier shall be responsible only if
it had been placed in his care. Such other luggage shall be deemed to include personal effects carried or
worn by the passenger.
2.
The carrier shall be relieved of this liability if the loss or damage results from an inherent defect in
the luggage, from a special risk inherent in its perishable or dangerous nature or from circumstances
which a carrier using the diligence which the particular facts of the case called for could not have avoided
and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.
3.
The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of any physical or mental failing of the driver,
of any defect in or malfunctioning of the vehicle, or of any wrongful act or neglect on the part of the
person from whom he may have hired the vehicle or of the persons for whom the latter would have been
responsible, in accordance with the provisions of article4, if he had himself been the carrier.
Article 15
1.
Luggage not delivered within fourteen days from the date on which the passenger claims it shall be
deemed to be lost.
2.
If a piece of luggage which is deemed to be lost is recovered within one year following the date on
which the passenger claims it, the carrier shall take all reasonable steps to notify the passenger. Within
the thirty days following receipt of such notification the passenger may, against refund of any
compensation which may have been paid in respect of the loss but without prejudice to any claims to
compensation for delay, have the piece of luggage delivered to him either at the place of departure or at
the place appointed for delivery.
Article 16
1.
When under the provisions of this Convention a carrier is liable for compensation in respect of total
or partial loss of or in respect of damage to luggage, such compensation shall be claimable in an amount
equal to the amount of the loss or damage, but is shall not exceed 500 francs for each piece of luggage
nor 2,000 francs for each passenger. Compensation may also be claimed in respect of total or partial
loss of or in respect of damage to personal effects carried or worn by the passenger, but it shall not
exceed 1,000 francs for each passenger.
- 5-
2.
The amounts referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be exclusive of legal or other costs
incurred by the parties in asserting their rights, payment or reimbursement of which may devolve on the
carrier, and of interest calculated in conformity with the law judged applicable by the court seized of the
case.
3.
Higher limits may be agreed between the parties to the contract of carriage.
Section 3. General Provisions
Article 17
1.

extent that loss or damage results from the wrongful act or neglect of the passenger or from conduct by
the passenger not conforming to the normal conduct of a passenger.

Where the carrier is liable for the loss or damage but a third party has contributed thereto by his
acts or omissions, the carrier shall be liable for the whole of such loss or damage without prejudice to any
right or recourse he may have against such third party.
3.
The carrier shall not be liable under this Convention for loss or damage caused by a nuclear

If the loss or damage results from willful misconduct or gross negligence by the carrier or a person
for whom he is responsible under article 4, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the
provisions of this Convention which exclude his liability wholly or in part or which limit the compensation
payable. The same rule shall apply to a person for whom the carrier is responsible under article 4 if that
person''s liability is involved and the loss or damage results from willful misconduct or gross negligence by
that person.
3.
Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the total amount of compensation payable by
the carrier and by the persons for whom the carrier is responsible under article 4 shall not exceed the
amounts prescribed in the preceding sections of this chapter.

Article 21
1.
In all legal proceedings arising out of carriage under this Convention the plaintiff may bring an
action in any court or tribunal of a Contracting Party designated by agreement between the parties and, in
addition, in the courts or tribunals of the country within whose territory is situated:
(a)
(b)
(c)
the place where the defendant has his principal place of business, is habitually
resident or has the place of business through which the contract of carriage
was made; or
the place where the loss or damage occurred; or
the place of departure or of destination of the carriage;
and in no other court or tribunal.
2.
Where in respect of a claim to which paragraph 1 of this article applies an action is pending
before a court or tribunal competent under this paragraph or where in respect of such a claim judgement
has been entered by such a court or tribunal, no new action shall be started on the same grounds
between the same parties unless the judgement of the court or tribunal before which the first action was
brought is not enforceable in the country in which the fresh proceedings are brought.
3.
Where a judgement entered by a court or tribunal of a Contracting State, the said court or
tribunal having jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, in any such claim as is
referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has become enforceable in that State, such judgement shall
become enforceable in each of the other Contracting States as soon as the formalities required in the
State concerned have been complied with. The merits of the case shall not be re-opened.
4.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply to judgements after trial, judgements by
default and settlements confirmed by an order or the court, but shall not apply to interim judgements or to
awards of damages in addition to costs against a plaintiff who fails wholly or partly in his action.

The period of limitation for actions arising out of the death or wounding of or out of any other
bodily or mental injury to a passenger shall be three years.

had or should have had knowledge of it. However, the period of limitation shall not exceed five years
from the date of the accident.

The period of limitation for actions arising out of carriage under this Convention other than those
referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall in all cases be one year.

have arrived at the place of destination of the passenger.
3.
A written claim shall suspend the period of limitation until the date on which the carrier rejects the
claim by notification in writing and returns any documents handed to him in support of the claim. If a part
of the claim is admitted, the period of limitation shall start to run again only in respect of that part of the
claim which is still in dispute. The burden of proof of the receipt of the claim or of the reply and of the
return of the documents shall rest with the party relying upon those facts. Further claims having the same
object shall not suspend the running of the period of limitation unless the carrier agrees to consider them.
4.
Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the extension of the period of limitation shall
be governed by the provisions of the law of the court or tribunal seized of the case not including the rules
relating to conflict of laws. That law shall also govern the fresh accrual of rights of action.
