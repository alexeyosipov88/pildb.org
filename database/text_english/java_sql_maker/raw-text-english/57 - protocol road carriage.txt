(CMR) (1978 - THE CMR CONVENTION OF GENEVA, 19 MAY 1956 AS AMENDED BY THE CMR
PROTOCOL OF GENEVA, 5 JULY, 1978)
******************************************************************************

PREAMBLE
========

/ [PREAMBLE] /
--------------

The Contracting Parties,

Having recognized the desirability of standardizing the conditions governing
the contract for the international carriage of goods by road, particularly with
respect to the documents used for such carriage and to the carrier's liability,

Have agreed as follows:

CHAPTER 1 - SCOPE OF APPLICATION
================================

ARTICLE 1
---------

1. This Convention shall apply to every contract for the carriage of goods by
road in vehicles for reward, when the place of taking over of the goods and the
place designated for delivery, as specified in the contract, are situated in
two different countries, of which at least one is a contracting country,
irrespective of the place of residence and the nationality of the parties.

2. For the purpose of this Convention, "vehicles" means motor vehicles,
articulated vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers as defined in article 4 of the
Convention on Road Traffic dated 19 September 1949.

3. This Convention shall apply also where carriage coming within its scope is
carried out by States or by governmental institutions or organizations.

4. This Convention shall not apply:

(a) To carriage performed under the terms of any international postal
convention;

(b) To funeral consignments;

(c) To furniture removal.

5. The Contracting Parties agree not to vary any of the provisions of this
Convention by special agreements between two or more of them, except to make it
inapplicable to their frontier traffic or to authorize the use in transport
operations entirely confined to their territory of consignment notes
representing a title to the goods.

ARTICLE 2
---------

1. Where the vehicle containing the goods is carried over part of the journey
by sea, rail, inland waterways or air, and, except where the provisions of
article 14 are applicable, the goods are not unloaded from the vehicle, this
Convention shall nevertheless apply to the whole of the carriage. Provided that
to the extent it is proved that any loss, damage or delay in delivery of the
goods which occurs during the carriage by the other means of transport was not
caused by act or omission of the carrier by road, but by some event which could
only occurred in the course of and by reason of the carriage by that other
means of transport, the liability of the carrier by road shall be determined
not by this convention but in the manner in which the liability of the carrier
by the other means of transport would have been determined if a contract for
the carriage the goods alone had been made by the sender with the carrier by
the other means of transport in accordance with the conditions prescribed by
law for the carriage of goods by that means of transport. If, however, there
are no such prescribed conditions, the liability of the carrier by road shall
be determined by this convention.

2. If the carrier by road is also himself the carrier by the other means of
transport, his liability shall also be determined in accordance with the
provisions paragraph 1 of this article, but as if, in his capacities as carrier
by road and carrier by the other means of transport, he were two separate
persons.

CHAPTER II - PERSONS FOR WHOM THE CARRIER IS RESPONSIBLE
========================================================

ARTICLE 3
---------

For the purposes of this Convention the carrier shall be responsible for the
acts of omissions of his agents and servants and of any other persons of whose
services he makes use for the performance of the carriage, when such agents,
servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their employment, as
if such acts or omissions were his own.

incorrect use of the documents specified in and accompanying the consignment

compensation payable by the carrier shall not exceed that payable in the event
of loss of the goods.

ARTICLE 12
----------

1. The sender has the right to dispose of the goods, in particular by asking
the carrier to stop the goods in transit, to change the place at which delivery
is to take place or to deliver the goods to a consignee other than the
consignee indicated in the consignment note.

2. This right shall cease to exist when the second copy of the consignment note
is handed to the consignee or when the consignee exercises his right under
article 13, paragraph 1; from that time onwards the carrier shall obey the
orders of the consignee.

3. The consignee shall, however, have the right of disposal from the time when
the consignment note is drawn up, if the sender makes an entry to that effect
in the consignment note.

4. If in exercising his right of disposal the consignee has ordered the
delivery of the goods to another person, that other person shall not be
entitled to name other consignees.

5. The exercise of the right of disposal shall be subject to the following
conditions:

(a) That the sender or, in the case referred to in paragraph 3 of this article,
the consignee who wishes to exercise the right produces the first copy of the
consignment note on which the new instructions to the carrier have been entered
and indemnifies the carrier against all expenses, loss and damage involved in
carrying out such instructions;

(b) That the carrying out of such instructions is possible at the time when the
instructions reach the person who is to carry them out and does not either
interfere with the normal working of the carriers' undertaking or prejudice the
senders or consignees of other consignments;

(c) That the instructions do not result in a division of the consignment.

6. When, by reason of the provisions of paragraph 5 (b) of this article, the
carrier cannot carry out the instructions which he receives, he shall
immediately notify the person who gave him such instructions.

7. A carrier who has not carried out the instructions given under the
conditions provided for in this article or who has carried them out without
requiring the first copy of the consignment note to be produced, shall be
liable to the person entitled to make a claim for any loss or damage caused
thereby.

ARTICLE 13
----------

1. After arrival of the goods at the place designated for delivery, the
consignee shall be entitled to require the carrier to deliver to him, against a
receipt, the second copy of the consignment note and the goods. If the loss of
the goods established or if the goods have not arrived after the expiry of the
period provided for in article 19, the consignee shall be entitled to enforce
in his own name against the carrier any rights arising from the contract of
carriage.

2. The consignee who avails himself of the rights granted to him under
paragraph 1 of this article shall pay the charges shown to be due on the
consignment note, but in the event of dispute on this matter the carrier shall
not be required to deliver the goods unless security has been furnished by the
consignee.

ARTICLE 14
----------

1. If for any reason it is or becomes impossible to carry out the contract in
accordance with the terms laid down in the consignment note before the goods
reach the place designated for delivery, the carrier shall ask for instructions
from the person entitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with the
provisions of article 12.

2. Nevertheless, if circumstances are such as to allow the carriage to be
carried out under conditions differing from those laid down in the consignment
note and if the carrier has been unable to obtain instructions in reasonable
time the person entitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with the
provisions of article 12, he shall take such steps as seem to him to be in the
best interests the person entitled to dispose of the goods

ARTICLE 15
----------

1. Where circumstances prevent delivery of the goods after their arrival at the
place designated for delivery, the carrier shall ask the sender for his
instructions. If the consignee refuses the goods the sender shall be entitled
to dispose of them without being obliged to produce the first copy of the
consignment note.

2. Even if he has refused the goods, the consignee may nevertheless require
delivery so long as the carrier has not received instructions to the contrary
from the sender.

3. When circumstances preventing delivery of the goods arise after the
consignee, in exercise of his rights under article 12, paragraph 3, has given
an order for the goods to be delivered to another person, paragraphs 1 and 2 of
this article shall apply as if the consignee were the sender and that other
person were the consignee.

ARTICLE 16
----------

1. The carrier shall be entitled to recover the cost of his request for
instructions and any expenses entailed in carrying out such instructions,
unless such expenses were caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the carrier.

2. In the cases referred to in article 14, paragraph 1, and in article 15, the
carrier may immediately unload the goods for account of the person entitled to
dispose of them and thereupon the carriage shall be deemed to be at an end. The
carrier shall then hold the goods on behalf of the person so entitled. He may,
however, entrust them to a third party, and in that case he shall not be under
any liability except for the exercise of reasonable care in the choice of such
third party. The charges due under the consignment note and all other expenses
shall remain chargeable against the goods.

3. The carrier may sell the goods, without awaiting instructions from the
person entitled to dispose of them, if the goods are perishable or their
condition warrants such a course, or when the storage expenses would be out of
proportion to the value of the goods. He may also proceed to the sale of the
goods in other cases if after the expiry of a reasonable period he has not
received from the person entitled to dispose of the goods instructions to the
contrary which he may reasonably be required to carry out.

4. If the goods have been sold pursuant to this article, the proceeds of sale,
after deduction of the expenses chargeable against the goods, shall be placed
at the disposal of the person entitled to dispose of the goods. If these
charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the carrier shall be entitled to the
difference.

5. The procedure in the case of sale shall be determined by the law or custom
of the place where the goods are situated.

CHAPTER IV - LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER
=====================================

ARTICLE 17
----------

1. The carrier shall be liable for the total or partial loss of the goods and
for damage thereto occurring between the time when he takes over the goods and
the time of delivery, as well as for any delay in delivery.

2. The carrier shall, however, be relieved of liability if the loss, damage or
delay was caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the claimant, by the
instructions of the claimant given otherwise than as the result of a wrongful
act or neglect on the part of the carrier, by inherent vice of the goods or
through circumstances which the carrier could not avoid and the consequences of
which he was unable to prevent.

3. The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of the defective
condition of the vehicle used by him in order to perform the carriage, or by
reason of the wrongful act or neglect of the person from whom he may have hired
the vehicle or of the agents or servants of the latter.

4. Subject to article 18, paragraphs 2 to 5, the carrier shall be relieved of
liability when the loss or damage arises from the special risks inherent in one
more of the following circumstances:

(a) Use of open unsheeted vehicles, when their use has been expressly agreed
and specified in the consignment note;

(b) The lack of, or defective condition of packing in the case of goods which,
by their nature, are liable to wastage or to be damaged when not packed or when
not properly packed;

(c) Handling, loading, stowage or unloading of the goods by the sender, the
consignee or person acting on behalf of the sender or the consignee;

(d) The nature of certain kinds of goods which particularly exposes them to
total or partial loss or to damage, especially through breakage, rust, decay,
desiccation, leakage, normal wastage, or the action of moth or vermin;

(f) Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks or numbers on the packages;

(g) The carriage of livestock.

5. Where under this article the carrier is not under any liability in respect
some of the factors causing the loss, damage or delay, he shall only be liable
the extent that those factors for which he is liable under this article have
contributed to the loss, damage or delay.

ARTICLE 18
----------

1. The burden of proving that loss, damage or delay was due to one of the
specified in article 17, paragraph 2, shall rest upon the carrier.

2. When the carrier establishes that in the circumstances of the case, the loss
damage could be attributed to one or more of the special risks referred to in
article 17, paragraph 4, it shall be presumed that it was so caused. The
claimant shall, however, be entitled to prove that the loss or damage was not,
in fact, attributable either wholly or partly to one of these risks.

3. This presumption shall not apply in the circumstances set out in article 17,
paragraph 4 (a), if there has been an abnormal shortage, or a loss of any
package.

4. If the carriage is performed in vehicles specially equipped to protect the
goods from the effects of heat, cold, variations in temperature or the humidity
of the air, the carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article
17, paragraph 4 (d), unless he proves that all steps incumbent on him in the
circumstances with respect to the choice, maintenance and use of such equipment
were taken and that he complied with any special instructions issued to him.

5. The carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article 17,
paragraph 4 (f), unless he proves that all steps normally incumbent on him in
the circumstances were taken and that he complied with any special instructions
issued to him.

ARTICLE 19
----------

Delay in delivery shall be said to occur when the goods have not been delivered
within the agreed time-limit or when, failing an agreed time-limit, the actual
duration of the carriage having regard to the circumstances of the case, and in
particular, in the case of partial loads, the time required for making up a
complete load in the normal way, exceeds the time it would be reasonable to
allow a diligent carrier.

ARTICLE 20
----------

1. The fact that goods have not been delivered within thirty days following the
expiry of the agreed time-limit, or, if there is no agreed time-limit, within
sixty days from the time when the carrier took over the goods, shall be
conclusive evidence of the loss of the goods, and the person entitled to make a
claim may thereupon treat them as lost.

2. The person so entitled may, on receipt of compensation for the missing
goods, request in writing that he shall be notified immediately should the
goods be recovered in the course of the year following the payment of
compensation. He shall be given a written acknowledgement of such request.

3. Within the thirty days following receipt of such notification, the person
entitled as aforesaid may require the goods to be delivered to him against
payment of the charges shown to be due on the consignment note and also against
refund of the compensation he received less any charges included therein but
without prejudice to any claims to compensation for delay in delivery under
article 23 and where applicable, article 26.

4. In the absence of the request mentioned in paragraph 2 or of any
instructions given within the period of thirty days specified in paragraph 3,
or if the goods are not recovered until more than one year after the payment of
compensation , the carrier shall be entitled to deal with them in accordance
with the law place where the goods are situated.

ARTICLE 21
----------

Should the goods have been delivered to the consignee without collection of the
"cash on delivery" charge which should have been collected by the carrier under
terms of the contract of carriage, the carrier shall be liable to the sender
for compensation not exceeding the amount of such charge without prejudice to
his right of action against the consignee.

ARTICLE 22
----------

1. When the sender hands goods of a dangerous nature to the carrier, he shall
inform the carrier of the exact nature of the danger and indicate if necessary,
precautions to be taken. If this information has not been entered in the
consignment note, the burden of proving, by some other means, that the carrier
knew the exact nature of the danger constituted by the carriage of the said
goods shall rest upon the sender or the consignee.

2. Goods of a dangerous nature which, in the circumstance referred to in
paragraph 1 of this article, the carrier did not know were dangerous, may, at
any time or place, be unloaded, destroyed or rendered harmless by the carrier
without compensation; further, the sender shall be liable for all expenses,
loss or damage arising out of their handing over for carriage or of their
carriage.

ARTICLE 23
----------

1. When, under the provisions of this Convention, a carrier is liable for
compensation in respect of total or partial loss of goods, such compensation
shall be calculated by reference to the value of the goods at the place and
time at which they were accepted for carriage.

2. The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange
price or, if there is no such price, according to the current market price or,
if there is no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference
to normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.

3. Compensation shall not, however, exceed 8.33 units of account per kilogram
of gross weight short.

4. In addition, the carriage charges, Customs duties and other charges incurred
in respect of the carriage of the goods shall be refunded in full in case of
total loss and in proportion to the loss sustained in case of partial loss, but
no further damage shall be payable.

5. In the case of delay if the claimant proves that damage has resulted
therefrom the carrier shall pay compensation for such damage not exceeding the
carriage charges.

6. Higher compensation may only be claimed where the value of the goods or a
special interest in delivery has been declared in accordance with articles 24
and 26.

7. The unit of account mentioned in this Convention is the Special Drawing
Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amount mentioned in
paragraph 3 of this article shall be converted into the national currency of
the State of the Court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that
currency on the date of the judgment or the date agreed upon by the Parties.
The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a
State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated
in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International
Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and
transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special
Drawing Right, of a State which is not a member of the International Monetary
Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by the State.

8. Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary
Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of
paragraph 7 of this article may, at the time of ratification of or accession to
the Protocol to the CMR or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of
liability provided for in paragraph 3 of this article to be applied in its
territory shall be 25 monetary units. The monetary unit referred to in this
paragraph corresponds to the 10/31 gram of gold of millesimal fineness nine
hundred. The conversion shall be made according to the law of the State
concerned.

9. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of this
article and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 8 of this article shall be
made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State as
far as possible the same real value for the amount in paragraph 3 of this
article as is expressed there in units of account. States shall communicate to
the Secretary-General of the United Nations the manner of calculation pursuant
to paragraph 7 of this article or the result of the conversion in paragraph 8
of this article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument referred to
in Article 3 of the Protocol to the CMR and whenever there is a change in
either.

ARTICLE 24
----------

The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, declare in
the consignment note a value for the goods exceeding the limit laid down in
article 23, paragraph 3, and in that case the amount of the declared value
shall be substituted for that limit.

ARTICLE 25
----------

1. In case of damage, the carrier shall be liable for the amount by which the
goods have diminished in value, calculated by reference to the value of the
goods fixed in accordance with article 23, paragraphs 1, 2 and 4.

2. The compensation may not, however, exceed:

(a) If the whole consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in the case
of total loss;

(b) If part only of the consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in the
case of loss of the part affected.

ARTICLE 26
----------

1. The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, fix the
amount of a special interest in delivery in the case of loss or damage or of
the agreed time-limit being exceeded, by entering such amount in the
consignment note.

2. If a declaration of a special interest in delivery has been made,
compensation for the additional loss or damage proved may be claimed, up to the
total amount of the interest declared, independently of the compensation
provided for in articles 23, 24 and 25.

ARTICLE 27
----------

1. The claimant shall be entitled to claim interest on compensation payable.
Such interest, calculated at five per centum per annum, shall accrue from the
date on which the claim was sent in writing to the carrier or, if no such claim
has been made, from the date on which legal proceedings were instituted.

2. When the amounts on which the calculation of the compensation is based are
not expressed in the currency of the country in which payment is claimed,
conversion shall be at the rate of exchange applicable on the day and at the
place of payment of compensation.

ARTICLE 28
----------

1. In cases where, under the law applicable, loss, damage or delay arising out
of carriage under this Convention gives rise to an extra-contractual claim, the
carrier may avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude
his liability of which fix or limit the compensation due.

2. In cases where the extra-contractual liability for loss, damage or delay of
one of the persons for whom the carrier is responsible under the terms of
article 3 is in issue, such person may also avail himself of the provisions of
this Convention which exclude the liability of the carrier or which fix or
limit the compensation due.

ARTICLE 29
----------

1. The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this
chapter which exclude or limit his liability or which shift the burden of proof
if the damage was caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on his
part as, in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seised of the
case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct.

2. The same provision shall apply if the wilful misconduct or default is
committed by the agents or servants of the carrier or by any other persons of
whose services he makes use for the performance of the carriage, when such
agents, servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their
employment. Furthermore, in such a case such agents, servants or other persons
shall not be entitled to avail themselves, with regard to their personal
liability, of the provisions of this chapter referred to in paragraph 1.

CHAPTER V - CLAIMS AND ACTIONS
==============================

ARTICLE 30
----------

1. If the consignee takes delivery of the goods without duly checking their
condition with the carrier or without sending him reservations giving a general
indication of the loss or damage, not later than the time of delivery in the
case of apparent loss or damage and within seven days of delivery, Sundays and
public holidays excepted, in the case of loss or damage which is not apparent,
the fact of this taking delivery shall be prima facie, evidence that he has
received the goods in the condition described in the consignment note. In the
case of loss or damage which is not apparent the reservations referred to shall
be made in writing.

2. When the condition of the goods has been duly checked by the consignee and
the carrier, evidence contradicting the result of this checking shall only be
admissible in the case of loss or damage which is not apparent and provided
that the consignee has duly sent reservations in writing to the carrier within
seven days, Sundays and public holidays excepted, from the date of checking.

3. No compensation shall be payable for delay in delivery unless a reservation
has been sent in writing to the carrier, within twenty-one days from the time
that the goods were placed at the disposal of the consignee.

4. In calculating the time-limits provided for in this article the date of
delivery, or the date of checking, or the date when the goods were placed at
the disposal of the consignee, as the case may be, shall not be included.

5. The carrier and the consignee shall give each other every reasonable
facility for making the requisite investigations and checks.

ARTICLE 31
----------

1. In legal proceedings arising out of carriage under this Convention, the
plaintiff may bring an action in any court or tribunal of a contracting country
designated by agreement between the parties and, in addition, in the courts or
tribunals of a country within whose territory:

(a) The defendant is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of
business, or the branch or agency through which the contract of carriage was
made, or (b) The place where the goods were taken over by the carrier or the
place designated for delivery is situated. 2. Where in respect of a claim
referred to in paragraph 1 of this article an action is pending before a court
or tribunal competent under that paragraph, or where in respect of such a claim
a judgement has been entered by such a court or tribunal no new action shall be
started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the judgement of
the court or tribunal before which the first action was brought is not
enforceable in the country in which the fresh proceedings are brought.

3. When a judgement entered by a court or tribunal of a contracting country in
any such action as is referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has become
enforceable in that country, it shall also become enforceable in each of the
other contracting States, as soon as the formalities required in the country
concerned have been complied with. These formalities shall not permit the
merits of the case to be re-opened.

4. The provisions of paragraph 3 of this article shall apply to judgements
after trial, judgements by default and settlements confirmed by an order of the
court, but shall not apply to interim judgements or to awards of damages, in
addition to costs against a plaintiff who wholly or partly fails in his action.

5. Security for costs shall not be required in proceedings arising out of
carriage under this Convention from nationals of contracting countries resident
or having their place of business in one of those countries.

ARTICLE 32
----------

1. The period of limitation for an action arising out of carriage under this
Convention shall be one year. Nevertheless, in the case of wilful misconduct,
or such default as in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seised
of the case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct, the period of
limitation shall be three years. The period of limitation shall begin to run:

(a) In the case of partial loss, damage or delay in delivery, from the date of
delivery;

(b) In the case of total loss, from the thirtieth day after the expiry of the
agreed time-limit or where there is no agreed time-limit from the sixtieth day
from the date on which the goods were taken over by the carrier;

(c) In all other cases, on the expiry of a period of three months after the
making of the contract of carriage.

The day on which the period of limitation begins to run shall not be included
in the period.

2. A written claim shall suspend the period of limitation until such date as
the carrier rejects the claim by notification in writing and returns the
documents attached thereto. If a part of the claim is admitted the period of
limitation shall start to run again only in respect of that part of the claim
still in dispute. The burden of proof of the receipt of the claim, or of the
reply and of the return of the documents, shall rest with the party relying
upon these facts. The running of the period of limitation shall not be
suspended by further claims having the same object.

3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, the extension of the period
of limitation shall be governed by the law of the court or tribunal seized of
the case. That law shall also govern the fresh accrual of rights of action.

4. A right of action which has become barred by lapse of time may not be
exercised by way of counterclaim or set-off.

ARTICLE 33
----------

The contract of carriage may contain a clause conferring competence on an
arbitration tribunal if the clause conferring competence on the tribunal
provides that the tribunal shall apply this Convention.

=============================================================================

ARTICLE 34
----------

If carriage governed by a single contract is performed by successive road

the contract of carriage, under the terms of the consignment note, by reason of
his acceptance of the goods and the consignment note.

provided for in article 8, paragraph 2.

carriers .

ARTICLE 36
----------

Except in the case of a counterclaim or a setoff raised in an action concerning
a claim based on the same contract of carriage, legal proceedings in respect of
liability for loss, damage or delay may only be brought against the first
carrier, the last carrier or the carrier who was performing that portion of the
carriage during which the event causing the loss, damage or delay occurred, an
action may be brought at the same time against several of these carriers.

ARTICLE 37
----------

A carrier who has paid compensation in compliance with the provisions of this
Convention, shall be entitled to recover such compensation, together with
interest thereon and all costs and expenses incurred by reason of the claim,
from the other carriers who have taken part in the carriage, subject to the
following provisions:

(a) The carrier responsible for the loss or damage shall be solely liable for
the compensation whether paid by himself or by another carrier;

(b) When the loss or damage has been caused by the action of two or more
carriers, each of them shall pay an amount proportionate to his share of
liability; should it be impossible to apportion the liability, each carrier
shall be liable in proportion to the share of the payment for the carriage
which is due to him;

(c) If it cannot be ascertained to which carriers liability is attributable for
the loss or damage, the amount of the compensation shall be apportioned between
all the carriers as laid down in (b) above.

ARTICLE 38
----------

If one of the carriers is insolvent, the share of the compensation due from him
and unpaid by him shall be divided among the other carriers in proportion to
the share of the payment for the carriage due to them.

ARTICLE 39
----------

1. No carrier against whom a claim is made under articles 37 and 38 shall be
entitled to dispute the validity of the payment made by the carrier making the
claim if the amount of the compensation was determined by judicial authority
after the first mentioned carrier had been given due notice of the proceedings
and afforded an opportunity of entering an appearance.

2. A carrier wishing to take proceedings to enforce his right of recovery may
make his claim before the competent court or tribunal of the country in which
one of the carriers concerned is ordinarily resident, or has his principal
place of business or the branch or agency through which the contract of
carriage was made. All the carriers concerned may be made defendants in the
same action.

3. The provisions of article 31, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall apply to judgements
entered in the proceedings referred to in articles 37 and 38.

4. The provisions of article 32 shall apply to claims between carriers. The
period of limitation shall, however, begin to run either on the date of the
final judicial decision fixing the amount of compensation payable under the
provisions of this Convention, or, if there is no such judicial decision, from
the actual date of payment.

Carriers shall be free to agree among themselves on provisions other than those
laid down in articles 37 and 38.
