Berne Additional Protocol (1914) relating to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
1. Where any country outside the Union fails
to protect in an adequate manner the works of
authors who are subject to the jurisdiction of
one of the contracting countries, nothing in
the Convention of the 13th November 1908
shall affect the right of such contracting
country to restrict the protection given to the
works of authors who are at the date of the
first publication thereof subjects or citizens of
the said non-union country, and are not effectively domiciled in one of the countries of the Union.
2. The right accorded by the present Protocol
to contracting States belongs equally to any of
their oversea possessions.
3. No restrictions introduced by virtue of
paragraph 1 of the present Protocol shall in any
way affect the rights which an author may have
acquired in respect of a work published in a
country of the Union before such restrictions
were put in force.
4. The States which restrict the grant of
copyright in accordance with the present
Protocol shall give notice thereof to the
Government of the Swiss Confederation by a
written declaration specifying the countries in
regard to which protection is restricted, and
the restrictions to which rights of authors who
are subject to the jurisdiction of these countries are subjected.
