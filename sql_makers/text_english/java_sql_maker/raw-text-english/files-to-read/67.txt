Article 18

Acquisition by an innocent person

1.

(a) the right or interest of the acquirer is not subject to the interest of that other person;

(b) the acquirer is not liable to that other person; and

(a) the credit, designating entry or interest is not rendered invalid, ineffective against third parties or liable to be reversed as a result of that defective entry; and

Article 19

Priority among competing interests

1. This Article determines priority between interests in the same intermediated securities which become effective against third parties under Article 12 or Article 13.

2. Subject to paragraph 5 and Article 20, interests that become effective against third parties under Article 12 have priority over any interest that becomes effective against third parties by any other method provided by the non-Convention law.

3. Interests that become effective against third parties under Article 12 rank among themselves according to the time of occurrence of the following events:

(a) if the relevant intermediary is itself the holder of the interest and the interest is effective against third parties under Article 12(3)(a), when the agreement granting the interest is entered into;

(b) when a designating entry is made;

(c) when a control agreement is entered into or, if the relevant intermediary is not a party to the control agreement, when the relevant intermediary receives notice of it.

4. If an intermediary has an interest that has become effective against third parties under Article 12 and makes a designating entry or enters into a control agreement with the consequence that an interest of another person becomes effective against third parties, the interest of that other person has priority over the interest of the intermediary unless that other person and the intermediary expressly agree otherwise.

5. A non-consensual security interest in intermediated securities arising under the applicable law has such priority as is afforded to it by that law.

6. As between persons entitled to any interests referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 and, to the extent permitted by the applicable law, paragraph 5, the priorities provided by this Article may be varied by agreement between those persons, but any such agreement does not affect third parties.

2. An interest in intermediated securities granted by an intermediary so as to become effective against third parties under Article 12 has priority over the rights of account holders of that intermediary unless, at the relevant time, the person to whom the interest is granted actually knows or ought to know that the interest granted violates the rights of one or more account holders.

 

 

CHAPTER IV - INTEGRITY OF THE INTERMEDIATED HOLDING SYSTEM

 

Article 21

1. Rights and interests of account holders of a relevant intermediary that have become effective against third parties under Article 11 and interests granted by such account holders that have become effective under Article 12 are effective against the insolvency administrator and creditors in any insolvency proceeding in relation to the relevant intermediary or in relation to any other person responsible for the performance of a function of the relevant intermediary under Article 7.

2. Paragraph 1 does not affect:

(a) any rule of law applicable in the insolvency proceeding relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors; or

(b) any rule of procedure relating to the enforcement of rights to property that is under the control or supervision of the insolvency administrator.

Article 22

Prohibition of upper-tier attachment

1. Subject to paragraph 3, no attachment of intermediated securities of an account holder shall be made against, or so as to affect:

(b) the issuer of any securities credited to a securities account of that account holder; or

(c) a person other than the account holder and the relevant intermediary.

3. A Contracting State may declare that under its non-Convention law an attachment of intermediated securities of an account holder made against or so as to affect a person other than the relevant intermediary has effect also against the relevant intermediary. Any such declaration shall identify that other person by name or description and shall specify the time at which such an attachment becomes effective against the relevant intermediary.

 

Article 23

1. An intermediary is neither bound nor entitled to give effect to any instructions in relation to intermediated securities of an account holder given by any person other than that account holder.

Article 24

Holding or availability of sufficient securities

1. An intermediary must, for each description of securities, hold or have available securities and intermediated securities of an aggregate number or amount equal to the aggregate number or amount of securities of that description credited to:

(a) securities accounts that it maintains for its account holders other than itself; and

(b) if applicable, securities accounts that it maintains for itself.

2. An intermediary may comply with paragraph 1 by:

(e) any other appropriate method.

3. If at any time the requirements of paragraph 1 are not complied with, the intermediary must within the time permitted by the non-Convention law take such action as is necessary to ensure compliance with those requirements.

4. This Article does not affect any provision of the non-Convention law, or, to the extent permitted by the non-Convention law, any provision of the uniform rules of a securities settlement system or of the account agreement, relating to the method of complying with the requirements of this Article or the allocation of the cost of ensuring compliance with those requirements or otherwise relating to the consequences of failure to comply with those requirements.

 

Article 25

Allocation of securities to account holders' rights

1. Securities and intermediated securities of each description held by an intermediary as described in Article 24(2) shall be allocated to the rights of the account holders of that intermediary, other than itself, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Article 24(1)(a).

2. Subject to Article 20, securities and intermediated securities allocated under paragraph 1 shall not form part of the property of the intermediary available for distribution among or realisation for the benefit of creditors of the intermediary.

3. The allocation required by paragraph 1 shall be effected by the non-Convention law and, to the extent required or permitted by the non-Convention law, by arrangements made by the relevant intermediary.

4. The arrangements referred to in paragraph 3 may include arrangements under which an intermediary holds securities and intermediated securities in segregated form for the benefit of:

(a) its account holders generally; or

(b) particular account holders or groups of account holders,

in such manner as to ensure that such securities and intermediated securities are allocated in accordance with paragraph 1.

5. A Contracting State may declare that, if all securities and intermediated securities held by an intermediary for its account holders, other than itself, are in segregated form under arrangements such as are referred to in paragraph 4, under its non-Convention law the allocation required by paragraph 1 applies only to those securities and intermediated securities and does not apply to securities and intermediated securities held by an intermediary for its own account.

6. This Article applies notwithstanding the commencement or continuation of an insolvency proceeding in relation to the intermediary.

 

Article 26

Loss sharing in case of insolvency of the intermediary

1. This Article applies in any insolvency proceeding in relation to an intermediary unless otherwise provided by any conflicting rule applicable in that proceeding.

2. If the aggregate number or amount of securities and intermediated securities of any description allocated under Article 25(1) to an account holder, a group of account holders or the intermediary's account holders generally (as the case may be) is less than the aggregate number or amount of securities of that description credited to the securities accounts of that account holder, that group of account holders or the intermediary's account holders generally, the shortfall shall be borne:

(a) if securities and intermediated securities have been allocated to a single account holder, by that account holder; and

(b) in any other case, by the account holders to whom the relevant securities have been allocated, in proportion to the respective number or amount of securities of that description credited to their securities accounts.

3. To the extent permitted by the non-Convention law, if the intermediary is the operator of a securities settlement system and the uniform rules of the system make provision in case of a shortfall, the shortfall shall be borne in the manner so provided.

 

Article 27

Insolvency of system operator or participant

To the extent permitted by the law governing a system, the following provisions shall have effect notwithstanding the commencement of an insolvency proceeding in relation to the operator of that system or any participant in that system and notwithstanding any invalidation, reversal or revocation that would otherwise occur under any rule applicable in an insolvency proceeding:

(a) any provision of the uniform rules of a securities settlement system or of a securities clearing system in so far as that provision precludes the revocation of any instruction given by a participant in the system for making a disposition of intermediated securities, or for making a payment relating to an acquisition or disposition of intermediated securities, after the time at which that instruction is treated under the rules of the system as having been entered irrevocably into the system;

(b) any provision of the uniform rules of a securities settlement system in so far as that provision precludes the invalidation or reversal of a debit or credit of securities to, or a designating entry or removal of a designating entry in, a securities account that forms part of the system after the time at which that debit, credit, designating entry or removal of a designating entry is treated under the rules of the system as not liable to be reversed.

 

Article 28

Obligations and liability of intermediaries

1. The obligations of an intermediary under this Convention, including the manner in which an intermediary complies with its obligations, may be specified by the non-Convention law and, to the extent permitted by the non-Convention law, the account agreement or the uniform rules of a securities settlement system.

2. If the substance of any such obligation is specified by the non-Convention law or, to the extent permitted by the non-Convention law, the account agreement or the uniform rules of a securities settlement system, compliance with it satisfies that obligation.

3. The liability of an intermediary in relation to its obligations is governed by the non-Convention law and, to the extent permitted by the non-Convention law, the account agreement or the uniform rules of a securities settlement system.

4. An intermediary may not exclude liability for its gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

 

Article 29

Position of issuers of securities

1. The law of a Contracting State shall permit the holding through one or more intermediaries of securities that are permitted to be traded on an exchange or regulated market, and the effective exercise in accordance with Article 9 of the rights attached to such securities that are so held, but need not require that all such securities be issued on terms that permit them to be held through intermediaries.

2. In particular, the law of a Contracting State shall recognise the holding of such securities by a person acting in its own name on behalf of another person or other persons and shall permit such a person to exercise voting or other rights in different ways in relation to different parts of a holding of securities of the same description; but this Convention does not determine the conditions under which such a person is authorised to exercise such rights.

 

Article 30

Set-off

As between an account holder that holds intermediated securities for its own account and the issuer of those securities, the fact that the account holder holds the securities through an intermediary or intermediaries shall not of itself, in any insolvency proceeding in relation to the issuer, preclude the existence or prevent the exercise of any rights of set-off which would have existed and been exercisable if the account holder had held the securities otherwise than through an intermediary.
