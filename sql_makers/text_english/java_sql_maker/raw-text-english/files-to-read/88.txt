CHAPTER I - AMENDMENTS TO THE CONVENTION
========================================

ARTICLE I
---------

The Convention which the provisions of the present Chapter modify is the Warsaw
Convention as amended at The Hague in 1955, and at Guatemala City in 1971.

ARTICLE II
----------

.Article 22 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:-

  "Article 22

  1.

    (a) In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier is limited to
    the sum of 100 000 Special Drawing Rights for the aggregate of the claims,
    however founded, in respect of damage suffered as a result of the death or
    personal injury of each passenger. Where, in accordance with the law of the
    court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodic
    payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not
    exceed 100 000 Special Drawing Rights.

    (b) In the case of delay in the carriage of persons the liability of the
    carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 150 Special Drawing Rights.

    (c) In the carriage of baggage the liability of the carrier in the case of
    destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 000 Special Drawing
    Rights for each passenger.

    2. (a) In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to
    a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has
    made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a
    special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a
    supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be
    liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that
    that sum is greater than the consignor's actual interest in delivery at
    destination.

    (b) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any
    object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in
    determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be
    only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless,
    when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object
    contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same
    air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be
    taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.

  3.

    (a) The courts of the High Contracting Parties which are not authorized
    under their law to award the costs of the action, including lawyers' fees,
    shall, in actions to which this Convention applies, have the power to
    award, in their discretion, to the claimant the whole or part of the costs
    of the action, including lawyers' fees which the court considers
    reasonable.

    (b) The costs of the action including lawyers' fees shall be awarded in
    accordance with subparagraph (a) only if the claimant gives a written
    notice to the carrier of the amount claimed including the particulars of
    the calculation of that amount and the carrier does not make, within a
    period of six months after his receipt of such notice, a written offer of
    settlement in an amount at least equal to the compensation awarded within
    the applicable limit. This period will be extended until the time of
    commencement of the action if that is later.

    (c) The costs of the action including lawyers' fees shall not be taken into
    account in applying the limits under this Article.

  4. The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Article and
  Article 42 shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined
  by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national
  currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the
  value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of
  the judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special
  Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the
  International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the
  method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at
  the date of the judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a
  national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High
  Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund,
  shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party.

  Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International
  Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions
  of paragraphs 1 and 2(a) of Article 22 may, at the time of ratification or
  accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of
  the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of
  1 500 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1(a) of
  Article 22; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph
  1(b) of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to
  paragraph 1(c) of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme with
  respect to paragraph 2(a) of Article 22. A State applying the provisions of
  this paragraph may also declare that the sum referred to in paragraphs 2 and
  3 of Article 42 shall be the sum of 187 500 monetary units. This monetary
  unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal
  fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency
  concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national
  currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned."

ARTICLE III
-----------

In Article 42 of the Convention- paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be deleted and
replaced by the following:-

  "2. At each of the Conferences mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article the
  limit of liability in Article 22, paragraph 1 (a) in force at the respective
  dates of these Conferences shall not be increased by an amount exceeding 12
  500 Special Drawing Rights.

  3. Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, unless before the thirty- first
  December of the fifth and tenth year after the date of entry into force of
  the Protocol referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article the aforesaid
  Conferences decide otherwise by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties
  present and voting, the limit of liability in Article 22, paragraph 1 (a) in
