The States Parties to this Convention,

Recognizing the serious consequences of acts of unlawful interference with aircraft which cause damage to third parties and to property;

Recognizing that there are currently no harmonized rules relating to such consequences;

Recognizing the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of third-party victims and the need for equitable compensation, as well as the need to protect the aviation industry from the consequences of damage caused by unlawful interference with aircraft;

Considering the need for a coordinated and concerted approach to providing compensation to third-party victims, based on cooperation between all affected parties;

Reaffirming the desirability of the orderly development of international air transport operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944; and

Convinced that collective State action for harmonization and codification of certain rules governing compensation for the consequences of an event of unlawful interference with aircraft in flight through a new Convention is the most desirable and effective means of achieving an equitable balance of interests;

Have agreed as follows:

Chapter I - Principles
Article 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Convention:

a.	
an "act of unlawful interference" means an act which is defined as an offence in the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, Signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, or the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Signed at Montréal on 23 September 1971, and any amendment in force at the time of the event;

b.	
an "event" occurs when damage results from an act of unlawful interference involving an aircraft in flight;

c.	
an aircraft is considered to be "in flight" at any time from the moment when all its external doors are closed following embarkation or loading until the moment when any such door is opened for disembarkation or unloading;

d.	
"international flight" means any flight whose place of departure and whose intended destination are situated within the territories of two States, whether or not there is a break in the flight, or within the territory of one State if there is an intended stopping place in the territory of another State;

e.	
"maximum mass" means the maximum certificated take-off mass of the aircraft, excluding the effect of lifting gas when used;

f.	
"operator" means the person who makes use of the aircraft, provided that if control of the navigation of the aircraft is retained by the person from whom the right to make use of the aircraft is derived, whether directly or indirectly, that person shall be considered the operator. A person shall be considered to be making use of an aircraft when he or she is using it personally or when his or her servants or agents are using the aircraft in the course of their employment, whether or not within the scope of their authority. The operator shall not lose its status as operator by virtue of the fact that another person commits an act of unlawful interference;

g.	
"person" means any natural or legal person, including a State;

h.	
"senior management" means members of an operator's supervisory board, members of its board of directors, or other senior officers of the operator who have the authority to make and have significant roles in making binding decisions about how the whole of or a substantial part of the operator's activities are to be managed or organized;

i.	
"State Party" means a State for which this Convention is in force; and

j.	
"third party" means a person other than the operator, passenger or consignor or consignee of cargo.

Article 2
Scope
1.	
This Convention applies to damage to third parties which occurs in the territory of a State Party caused by an aircraft in flight on an international flight, as a result of an act of unlawful interference. This Convention shall also apply to such damage that occurs in a State non-Party as provided for in Article 28.

2.	
If a State Party so declares to the Depositary, this Convention shall also apply to damage to third parties that occurs in the territory of that State Party which is caused by an aircraft in flight other than on an international flight, as a result of an act of unlawful interference.

3.	
For the purposes of this Convention:

(a)	
damage to a ship in or an aircraft above the High Seas or the Exclusive Economic Zone shall be regarded as damage occurring in the territory of the State in which it is registered; however, if the operator of the aircraft has its principal place of business in the territory of a State other than the State of Registry, the damage to the aircraft shall be regarded as having occurred in the territory of the State in which it has its principal place of business; and

(b)	
damage to a drilling platform or other installation permanently fixed to the soil in the Exclusive Economic Zone or the Continental Shelf shall be regarded as having occurred in the territory of the State Party which has jurisdiction over such platform or installation in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, done at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982.

4.	
This Convention shall not apply to damage caused by State aircraft. Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be deemed to be State aircraft.

Chapter II - Liability of the operator and related issues
Article 3
Liability of the operator
1.	
The operator shall be liable to compensate for damage within the scope of this Convention upon condition only that the damage was caused by an aircraft in flight.

2.	
There shall be no right to compensation under this Convention if the damage is not a direct consequence of the event giving rise thereto.

3.	
Damages due to death, bodily injury and mental injury shall be compensable. Damages due to mental injury shall be compensable only if caused by a recognizable psychiatric illness resulting either from bodily injury or from direct exposure to the likelihood of imminent death or bodily injury.

4.	
Damage to property shall be compensable.

5.	
Environmental damage shall be compensable, in so far as such compensation is provided for under the law of the State in the territory of which the damage occurred.

6.	
No liability shall arise under this Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident as defined in the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy (29 July 1960) or for nuclear damage as defined in the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (21 May 1963), and any amendment or supplements to these Conventions in force at the time of the event.

7.	
Punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.

Article 4
Limit of the operator's liability
1.	
The liability of the operator arising under Article 3 shall not exceed for an event the following limit based on the mass of the aircraft involved:

(a)	
750 000 Special Drawing Rights for aircraft having a maximum mass of 500 kilogrammes or less;

(b)	
1 500 000 Special Drawing Rights for aircraft having a maximum mass of more than 500 kilogrammes but not exceeding 1 000 kilogrammes;

(j)	
700 000 000 Special Drawing Rights for aircraft having a maximum mass of more than 500 000 kilogrammes.

2.	
If an event involves two or more aircraft operated by the same operator, the limit of liability in respect of the aircraft with the highest maximum mass shall apply.

Article 5
Events involving two or more operators
1.	
Where two or more aircraft have been involved in an event causing damage to which this Convention applies, the operators of those aircraft are jointly and severally liable for any damage suffered by a third party.

2.	
If two or more operators are so liable, the recourse between them shall depend on their respective limits of liability and their contribution to the damage.

3.	
No operator shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit, if any, applicable to its liability.

Article 6
Advance payments
If required by the law of the State where the damage occurred, the operator shall make advance payments without delay to natural persons who may be entitled to claim compensation under this Convention, in order to meet their immediate economic needs. Such advance payments shall not constitute a recognition of liability and may be offset against any amount subsequently payable as damages by the operator.

Article 7
Insurance
1.	
Having regard to Article 4, States Parties shall require their operators to maintain adequate insurance or guarantee covering their liability under this Convention. If such insurance or guarantee is not available to an operator on a per event basis, the operator may satisfy this obligation by insuring on an aggregate basis. States Parties shall not require their operators to maintain such insurance or guarantee to the extent that they are covered by a decision made pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 1(e) or Article 18, paragraph 3.

2.	
An operator may be required by the State Party in or into which it operates to furnish evidence that it maintains adequate insurance or guarantee. In doing so, the State Party shall apply the same criteria to operators of other States Parties as it applies to its own operators. Proof that an operator is covered by a decision made pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 1(e) or Article 18, paragraph 3, shall be sufficient evidence for the purpose of this paragraph.

Chapter III - The International Civil Aviation Compensation Fund

Article 12
Contributions to the International Fund
1.	
The contributions to the International Fund shall be:

(a)	
the mandatory amounts collected in respect of each passenger and each tonne of cargo departing on an international commercial flight from an airport in a State Party. Where a State Party has made a declaration under Article 2, paragraph 2, such amounts shall also be collected in respect of each passenger and each tonne of cargo departing on a commercial flight between two airports in that State Party; and

(b)	
such amounts as the Conference of Parties may specify in respect of general aviation or any sector thereof.

The operator shall collect these amounts and remit them to the International Fund.

2.	
Contributions collected in respect of each passenger and each tonne of cargo shall not be collected more than once in respect of each journey, whether or not that journey includes one or more stops or transfers.

Article 13
Basis for fixing the contributions
1.	
Contributions shall be fixed having regard to the following principles:

(a)	
the objectives of the International Fund should be efficiently achieved;

(b)	
competition within the air transport sector should not be distorted;

(c)	
the competitiveness of the air transport sector in relation to other modes of transportation should not be adversely affected; and

2.	
The Conference of Parties shall fix contributions in a manner that does not discriminate between States, operators, passengers and consignors or consignees of cargo.

3.	
On the basis of the budget drawn up according to Article 11, paragraph 1 (a), the contributions shall be fixed having regard to:

(a)	
the upper limit for compensation set out in Article 18, paragraph 2;

(b)	
the need for reserves where Article 18, paragraph 3, is applied;

Article 14
Period and rate of contributions
1.	
At its first meeting, the Conference of Parties shall decide the period and the rate of contributions in respect of passengers and cargo departing from a State Party to be made from the time of entry into force of this Convention for that State Party. If a State Party makes a declaration under Article 2, paragraph 2, initial contributions shall be paid in respect of passengers and cargo departing on flights covered by such declaration from the time it takes effect. The period and the rate shall be equal for all States Parties.

2.	
Contributions shall be fixed in accordance with paragraph 1 so that the funds available amount to 100 per cent of the limit of compensation set out in Article 18, paragraph 2, within four years. If the funds available are deemed sufficient in relation to the likely compensation or financial assistance to be provided in the foreseeable future and amount to 100 per cent of that limit, the Conference of Parties may decide that no further contributions shall be made until the next meeting of the Conference of Parties, provided that both the period and rate of contributions shall be applied in respect of passengers and cargo departing from a State in respect of which this Convention subsequently enters into force.

3.	
The total amount of contributions collected by the International Fund within any period of two consecutive calendar years shall not exceed three times the maximum amount of compensation according to Article 18, paragraph 2.

4.	
Subject to Article 28, the contributions collected by an operator in respect of a State Party may not be used to provide compensation for an event which occurred in its territory prior to the entry into force of this Convention for that State Party.

Article 15
Collection of the contributions
1.	
The Conference of Parties shall establish in the Regulations of the International Fund a transparent, accountable and cost-effective mechanism supporting the collection, remittal and recovery of contributions. When establishing the mechanism, the Conference of Parties shall endeavour not to impose undue burdens on operators and contributors to the funds of the International Fund. Contributions which are in arrears shall bear interest as provided for in the Regulations.

2.	
Where an operator does not collect or does not remit contributions it has collected to the International Fund, the International Fund shall take appropriate measures against such operator with a view to the recovery of the amount due. Each State Party shall ensure that an action to recover the amount due may be taken within its jurisdiction, notwithstanding in which State Party the debt actually accrued.

Article 16
Duties of States Parties
1.	
Each State Party shall take appropriate measures, including imposing such sanctions as it may deem necessary, to ensure that an operator fulfils its obligations to collect and remit contributions to the International Fund.

2.	
Each State Party shall ensure that the following information is provided to the International Fund:

(a)	
the number of passengers and quantity of cargo departing on international commercial flights from that State Party;

(b)	
such information on general aviation flights as the Conference of Parties may decide; and

(c)	
the identity of the operators performing such flights.

3.	
Where a State Party has made a declaration under Article 2, paragraph 2, it shall ensure that information detailing the number of passengers and quantity of cargo departing on commercial flights between two airports in that State Party, such information on general aviation flights as the Conference of Parties may decide, and the identity of the operators performing such flights, are also provided. In each case, such statistics shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

4.	
Where a State Party does not fulfil its obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and this results in a shortfall in contributions for the International Fund, the State Party shall be liable for such shortfall. The Conference of Parties shall, on recommendation by the Director, decide whether the State Party shall pay for such shortfall.

Article 17
The funds of the International Fund
1.	
The funds of the International Fund may only be used for the purposes set out in Article 8, paragraph 2.

2.	
The International Fund shall exercise the highest degree of prudence in the management and preservation of its funds. The funds shall be preserved in accordance with the Guidelines on Investment determined by the Conference of Parties under Article 9, subparagraph (h). Investments may only be made in States Parties.

3.	
Accounts shall be maintained for the funds of the International Fund. The auditors of the International Fund shall review the accounts and report on them to the Conference of Parties.

4.	
Where the International Fund is not able to meet valid compensation claims because insufficient contributions have been collected, it may obtain credits from financial institutions for the payment of compensation and may grant security for such credits.

Chapter IV Compensation from the International Fund
Article 18
Compensation
1.	
The International Fund shall, under the same conditions as are applicable to the liability of the operator, provide compensation to persons suffering damage in the territory of a State Party. Where the damage is caused by an aircraft in flight on a flight other than an international flight, compensation shall only be provided if that State Party has made a declaration according to Article 2, paragraph 2. Compensation shall only be paid to the extent that the total amount of damages exceeds the limits according to Article 4.

2.	
The maximum amount of compensation available from the International Fund shall be 3 000 000 000 Special Drawing Rights for each event. Payments made according to paragraph 3 of this Article and distribution of amounts recovered according to Article 25 shall be in addition to the maximum amount for compensation.

3.	
If and to the extent that the Conference of Parties determines and for the period that it so determines that insurance in respect of the damage covered by this Convention is wholly or partially unavailable with respect to amounts of coverage or the risks covered, or is only available at a cost incompatible with the continued operation of air transport generally, the International Fund may, at its discretion, in respect of future events causing damage compensable under this Convention, pay the damages for which the operators are liable under Articles 3 and 4 and such payment shall discharge such liability of the operators. The Conference of Parties shall decide on a fee, the payment of which by the operators, for the period covered, shall be a condition for the International Fund taking the action specified in this paragraph.

Article 19
Advance payments and other measures
1.	
Subject to the decision of the Conference of Parties and in accordance with the Guidelines for Compensation, the International Fund may make advance payments without delay to natural persons who may be entitled to claim compensation under this Convention, in order to meet their immediate economic needs. Such advance payments shall not constitute recognition of a right to compensation and may be offset against any amount subsequently payable by the International Fund.

2.	
Subject to the decision of the Conference of Parties and in accordance with the Guidelines for Compensation, the International Fund may also take other measures to minimize or mitigate damage caused by an event.

Chapter V - Special provisions on compensation and recourse
Article 20
Exoneration
If the operator or the International Fund proves that the damage was caused, or contributed to, by an act or omission of a claimant, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, done with intent or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result, the operator or the International Fund shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to that claimant to the extent that such act or omission caused or contributed to the damage.

Article 21
Court costs and other expenses
1.	
The limits prescribed in Articles 4 and 18, paragraph 2, shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the claimant, including interest.

2.	
Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the operator has offered in writing to the claimant within a period of six months from the date of the event causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, whichever is the later.

Article 22
Priority of compensation
If the total amount of the damages to be paid exceeds the amounts available according to Articles 4 and 18, paragraph 2, the total amount shall be awarded preferentially to meet proportionately the claims in respect of death, bodily injury and mental injury, in the first instance. The remainder, if any, of the total amount payable shall be awarded proportionately among the claims in respect of other damage.

Article 23
Additional compensation
1.	
To the extent the total amount of damages exceeds the aggregate amount payable under Articles 4 and 18, paragraph 2, a person who has suffered damage may claim additional compensation from the operator.

2.	
The operator shall be liable for such additional compensation to the extent the person claiming compensation proves that the operator or its employees have contributed to the occurrence of the event by an act or omission done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

3.	
Where an employee has contributed to the damage, the operator shall not be liable for any additional compensation under this Article if it proves that an appropriate system for the selection and monitoring of its employees has been established and implemented.

4.	
An operator or, if it is a legal person, its senior management shall be presumed not to have been reckless if it proves that it has established and implemented a system to comply with the security requirements specified pursuant to Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944) in accordance with the law of the State Party in which the operator has its principal place of business, or if it has no such place of business, its permanent residence.

Article 24
Right of recourse of the operator
The operator shall have a right of recourse against:

a.	
any person who has committed, organized or financed the act of unlawful interference; and

b.	
any other person.

Article 25
Right of recourse of the International Fund
The International Fund shall have a right of recourse against:

a.	
any person who has committed, organized or financed the act of unlawful interference;

b.	
the operator subject to the conditions set out in Article 23; and

c.	
any other person.

Article 26
Restrictions on rights of recourse
1.	
The rights of recourse under Article 24, subparagraph (b), and Article 25, subparagraph (c), shall only arise to the extent that the person against whom recourse is sought could have been covered by insurance available on a commercially reasonable basis.

2.	
Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the person against whom recourse is sought under Article 25, subparagraph (c) has contributed to the occurrence of the event by an act or omission done recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

3.	
The International Fund shall not pursue any claim under Article 25, subparagraph (c) if the Conference of Parties determines that to do so would give rise to the application of Article 18, paragraph 3.

Article 27
Exoneration from recourse

Chapter VI - Assistance in case of events in States non-Party
Article 28
Assistance in case of events in States non-Party
Where an operator, which has its principal place of business, or if it has no such place of business, its permanent residence, in a State Party, is liable for damage occurring in a State non-Party, the Conference of Parties may decide, on a case by case basis, that the International Fund shall provide financial support to that operator. Such support may only be provided:

a.	
in respect of damage that would have fallen under the Convention if the State non-Party had been a State Party;

b.	
if the State non-Party agrees in a form acceptable to the Conference of Parties to be bound by the provisions of this Convention in respect of the event giving rise to such damage;

c.	
up to the maximum amount for compensation set out in Article 18, paragraph 2; and

d.	
if the solvency of the operator liable is threatened even if support is given, where the Conference of Parties determines that the operator has sufficient arrangements protecting its solvency.

Chapter VII - Exercise of remedies and related provisions
Article 29
Exclusive remedy
1.	
Without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights, any action for compensation for damage to a third party due to an act of unlawful interference, however founded, whether under this Convention or in tort or in contract or otherwise, can only be brought against the operator and, if need be, against the International Fund and shall be subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this Convention. No claims by a third party shall lie against any other person for compensation for such damage.

2.	
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to an action against a person who has committed, organized or financed an act of unlawful interference.

Article 30
Conversion of Special Drawing Rights
The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement. The value in a national currency shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund for its operations and transactions. The value in a national currency, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value as the amounts in Article 4.

Article 31
Review of limits
1.	
Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, the sums prescribed in Articles 4 and 18, paragraph 2, shall be reviewed by the Director of the International Fund, by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of this Convention. The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in Article 30.

2.	
If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Director shall inform the Conference of Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become effective six months after the meeting of the Conference of Parties, unless a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval. The Director shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.

Article 32
Forum
1.	
Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, actions for compensation under the provisions of this Convention may be brought only before the courts of the State Party in whose territory the damage occurred.

2.	
Where damage occurs in more than one State Party, actions under the provisions of this Convention may be brought only before the courts of the State Party the territory of which the aircraft was in or about to leave when the event occurred.

3.	
Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, application may be made in any State Party for such provisional measures, including protective measures, as may be available under the law of that State.

Article 33
Intervention by the International Fund
1.	
Each State Party shall ensure that the International Fund has the right to intervene in proceedings brought against the operator in its courts.

2.	
Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this Article, the International Fund shall not be bound by any judgement or decision in proceedings to which it has not been a party or in which it has not intervened.

3.	
If an action is brought against the operator in a State Party, each party to such proceedings shall be entitled to notify the International Fund of the proceedings. Where such notification has been made in accordance with the law of the court seised and in such time that the International Fund had time to intervene in the proceedings, the International Fund shall be bound by a judgement or decision in proceedings even if it has not intervened.

Article 34
Recognition and enforcement of judgements
1.	
Subject to the provisions of this Article, judgements entered by a competent court under Article 32 after trial, or by default, shall when they are enforceable in the State Party of that court be enforceable in any other State Party as soon as the formalities required by that State Party have been complied with.

2.	
The merits of the case shall not be reopened in any application for recognition or enforcement under this Article.

3.	
Recognition and enforcement of a judgement may be refused if:

(a)	
its recognition or enforcement would be manifestly contrary to public policy in the State Party where recognition or enforcement is sought;

(b)	
the defendant was not served with notice of the proceedings in such time and manner as to allow him or her to prepare and submit a defence;

(c)	
it is in respect of a cause of action which had already, as between the same parties, formed the subject of a judgement or an arbitral award which is recognized as final and conclusive under the law of the State Party where recognition or enforcement is sought;

(d)	
the judgement has been obtained by fraud of any of the parties; or

(e)	
the right to enforce the judgement is not vested in the person by whom the application is made.

4.	
Recognition and enforcement of a judgement may also be refused to the extent that the judgement awards damages, including exemplary or punitive damages, that do not compensate a third party for actual harm suffered.

5.	
Where a judgement is enforceable, payment of any court costs and other expenses incurred by the plaintiff, including interest recoverable under the judgement, shall also be enforceable.

Article 35
Regional and multilateral agreements on the recognition and enforcement of judgements
1.	
States Parties may enter into regional and multilateral agreements regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgements consistent with the objectives of this Convention, provided that such agreements do not result in a lower level of protection for any third party or defendant than that provided for in this Convention.

2.	
States Parties shall inform each other, through the Depositary, of any such regional or multilateral agreements that they have entered into before or after the date of entry into force of this Convention.

This Convention shall enter into force on the one hundred and eightieth day after the deposit of the thirty-fifth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession on condition, however, that the total number of passengers departing in the previous year from airports in the States that have ratified, accepted, approved or acceded is at least 750 000 000 as appears from the declarations made by ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding States. If, at the time of deposit of the thirty-fifth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession this condition has not been fulfilled, the Convention shall not come into force until the one hundred and eightieth day after this condition shall have been satisfied. An instrument deposited by a Regional Economic Integration Organization shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.
