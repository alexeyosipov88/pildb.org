of a fact if he has actual knowledge of that fact or could not have been
unaware of its existence.

SECTION 2. - INTERPRETATION OF FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

ARTICLE 7
---------

The sum payable by an instrument is deemed to be a definite sum although the
instrument states that it is to be paid:

(a) With interest;

(b) By instalments at successive dates;

(c) By instalments at successive dates with a stipulation in the instrument
that upon default in payment of any instalment the unpaid balance becomes due;

(d) According to a rate of exchange indicated in the instrument or to be
determined as directed by the instrument; or

(e) In a currency other than the currency in which the sum is expressed in the
instrument.

ARTICLE 8
---------

1. If there is a discrepancy between the sum expressed in words and the sum
expressed in figures, the sum payable by the instrument is the sum expressed in
words.

2. If the sum is expressed more than once in words, and there is a discrepancy,
the sum payable is the smaller sum. The same rule applies if the sum is
expressed more than once in figures only, and there is a discrepancy.

3. If the sum is expressed in a currency having the same description as that of
at least one other State than the State where payment is to be made, as
indicated in the instrument, and the specified currency is not identified as
the currency of any particular State, the currency is to be considered as the
currency of the State where payment is to be made.

4. If an instrument states that the sum is to be paid with interest, without
specifying the date from which interest is to run, interest runs from the date
of the instrument.

5. A stipulation stating that the sum is to be paid with interest is deemed not
to have been written on the instrument unless it indicates the rate at which
interest is to be paid.

6. A rate at which interest is to be paid may be expressed either as a definite
rate or as a variable rate. For a variable rate to qualify for this purpose, it
must vary in relation to one or more reference rates of interest in accordance
with provisions stipulated in the instrument and each such reference rate must
be published or otherwise available to the public and not be subject, directly
or indirectly, to unilateral determination by a person who is named in the
instrument at the time the bill is drawn or the note is made, unless the person
is named only in the reference rate provisions.

7. If the rate at which interest is to be paid is expressed as a variable rate,
it may be stipulated expressly in the instrument that such rate shall not be
less than or exceed a specified rate of interest, or that the variations are
otherwise limited.

8. If a variable rate does not qualify under paragraph 6 of this article or for
any reason it is not possible to determine the numerical value of the variable
rate for any period, interest shall be payable for the relevant period at the
rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 70.

ARTICLE 9
---------

1. An instrument is deemed to be payable on demand:

(a) If it states that it is payable at sight or on demand or on presentment or
if it contains words of similar import; or

(b) If no time of payment is expressed.

2. An instrument payable at a definite time which is accepted or endorsed or
guaranteed after maturity is an instrument payable on demand as regards the
acceptor, the endorser or the guarantor.

3. An instrument is deemed to be payable at a definite time if it states that
it is payable:

(a) On a stated date or at a fixed period after a stated date or at a fixed
period after the date of the instrument;

(b) At a fixed period after sight;

(c) By instalments at successive dates; or

(d) By instalments at successive dates with the stipulation in the instrument
that upon default in payment of any instalment the unpaid balance becomes due.

4. The time of payment of an instrument payable at a fixed period after date is
determined by reference to the date of the instrument.

5. The time of payment of a bill payable at a fixed period after sight is
determined by the date of acceptance or, if the bill is dishonoured by
non-acceptance, by the date of protest or, if protest is dispensed with, by the
date of dishonour.

6. The time of payment of an instrument payable on demand is the date on which
the instrument is presented for payment.

7. The time of payment of a note payable at a fixed period after sight is
determined by the date of the visa signed by the maker on the note or, if his
visa is refused, by the date of presentment.

8. If an instrument is drawn, or made, payable one or more months after a
stated date or after the date of the instrument or after sight, the instrument
is payable on the corresponding date of the month when payment must be made. If
there is no corresponding date, the instrument is payable on the last day of
that month.

ARTICLE 10
----------

1. A bill may be drawn:

(a) By two or more drawers;

(b) Payable to two or more payees.

2. A note may be made:

(a) By two or more makers;

(b) Payable to two or more payees.

3. If an instrument is payable to two or more payees in the alternative, it is
payable to any one of them and any one of them in possession of the instrument
may exercise the rights of a holder. In any other case the instrument is
payable to all of them and the rights of a holder may be exercised only by all
of them.

ARTICLE 11
----------

A bill may be drawn by the drawer:

(a) On himself;

(b) Payable to his order.

SECTION 3. - COMPLETION OF AN INCOMPLETE INSTRUMENT

ARTICLE 12

1. An incomplete instrument which satisfies the requirements set out in
paragraph 1 of article 1 and bears the signature of the drawer or the
acceptance of the drawee, or which satisfies the requirements set out in
paragraph 2 of article 1 and paragraph 2 (d) of article 3, but which lacks
other elements pertaining to one or more of the requirements set out in
articles 2 and 3, may be completed, and the instrument so completed is
effective as a bill or a note.

2. If such an instrument is completed without authority or otherwise than in
accordance with the authority given:

(a) A party who signed the instrument before the completion may invoke such
lack of authority as a defence against a holder who had knowledge of such lack
of authority when he became a holder;

to the terms of the instrument so completed.

***********************

ARTICLE 13

An instrument is transferred:

(a) By endorsement and delivery of the instrument by the endorser to the
endorsee; or

(b) By mere delivery of the instrument if the last endorsement is in blank.

ARTICLE 14
----------

1. An endorsement must be written on the instrument or on a slip affixed
thereto ("allonge"). It must be signed.

2. An endorsement may be:

(a) In blank, that is, by a signature alone or by a signature accompanied by a
statement to the effect that the instrument is payable to a person in
possession of it;

(b) Special, that is, by a signature accompanied by an indication of the person
to whom the instrument is payable.

3. A signature alone, other than that of the drawee, is an endorsement only if
placed on the back of the instrument.

ARTICLE 15
----------

1. A person is a holder if he is:

(a) The payee in possession of the instrument; or

(b) In possession of an instrument which has been endorsed to him, or on which
the last endorsement is in blank, and on which there appears an uninterrupted
series of endorsements, even if any endorsement was forged or was signed by an
agent without authority.

2. If an endorsement in blank is followed by another endorsement, the person
who signed this last endorsement is deemed to be an endorsee by the endorsement
in blank.

3. A person is not prevented from being a holder by the fact that the
instrument was obtained by him or any previous holder under circumstances,
including incapacity or fraud, duress or mistake of any kind, that would give
rise to a claim to, or a defence against liability on, the instrument.

ARTICLE 16
----------

The holder of an instrument on which the last endorsement is in blank may:

(a) Further endorse it either by an endorsement in blank or by a special
endorsement;

(b) Convert the blank endorsement into a special endorsement by indicating in
the endorsement that the instrument is payable to himself or to some other
specified person; or

(c) Transfer the instrument in accordance with subparagraph (b) of article 13.

ARTICLE 17
----------

1. If the drawer or the maker has inserted in the instrument such words as "not
negotiable", "not transferable", "not to order", "pay (X) only", or words of
similar import, the instrument may not be transferred except for purposes of
collection, and any endorsement, even if it does not contain words authorizing
the endorsee to collect the instrument, is deemed to be an endorsement for
collection.

2. If an endorsement contains the words "not negotiable", "not transferable",
"not to order", "pay (X) only", or words of similar import, the instrument may
not be transferred further except for purposes of collection, and any
subsequent endorsement, even if it does not contain words authorizing the
endorsee to collect the instrument, is deemed to be an endorsement for
collection.

ARTICLE 18
----------

1. An endorsement must be unconditional.

2. A conditional endorsement transfers the instrument whether or not the
condition is fulfilled. The condition is ineffective as to those parties and
transferees who are subsequent to the endorsee.

ARTICLE 19
----------

An endorsement in respect of a part of the sum due under the instrument is
ineffective as an endorsement.

ARTICLE 20
----------

If there are two or more endorsements, it is presumed, unless the contrary is
proved, that each endorsement was made in the order in which it appears on the
instrument.

ARTICLE 21
----------

1. If an endorsement contains the words "for collection", "for deposit", "value
in collection", "by procuration", "pay any bank", or words of similar import
authorizing the endorsee to collect the instrument, the endorsee is a holder
who:

(a) May exercise all rights arising out of the instrument;

(b) May endorse the instrument only for purposes of collection;

(c) Is subject only to the claims and defences which may be set up against the
endorser.

2. The endorser for collection is not liable on the instrument to any
subsequent holder.

ARTICLE 22
----------

or any other words indicating a pledge, the endorsee is a holder who:

(a) May exercise all rights arising out of the instrument;

(b) May endorse the instrument only for purposes of collection;

(c) Is subject only to the claims and defences specified in article 28 or
article 30.

2. If such an endorsee endorses for collection, he is not liable on the
instrument to any subsequent holder.

ARTICLE 23
----------

The holder of an instrument may transfer it to a prior party or to the drawee
in accordance with article 13; however, if the transferee has previously been a
holder of the instrument, no endorsement is required, and any endorsement which
would prevent him from qualifying as a holder may be struck out.

ARTICLE 24
----------

An instrument may be transferred in accordance with article 13 after maturity,
except by the drawee, the acceptor or the maker.

ARTICLE 25
----------

1. If an endorsement is forged, the person whose endorsement is forged, or a
party who signed the instrument before the forgery, has the right to recover
compensation for any damage that he may have suffered because of the forgery
against:

(a) The forger;

(b) The person to whom the instrument was directly transferred by the forger;

(c) A party or the drawee who paid the instrument to the forger directly or
through one or more endorsees for collection.

2. However, an endorsee for collection is not liable under paragraph 1 of this
article if he is without knowledge of the forgery:

(a) At the time he pays the principal or advises him of the receipt of payment;
or

(b) At the time he receives payment, if this is later, unless his lack of
knowledge is due to his failure to act in good faith or to exercise reasonable
care.

3. Furthermore, a party or the drawee who pays an instrument is not liable
under paragraph 1 of this article if, at the time he pays the instrument, he is
without knowledge of the forgery, unless his lack of knowledge is due to his
failure to act in good faith or to exercise reasonable care.

4. Except as against the forger, the damages recoverable under paragraph 1 of
this article may not exceed the amount referred to in article 70 or article 71.

ARTICLE 26
----------

1. If an endorsement is made by an agent without authority or power to bind his
principal in the matter, the principal, or a party who signed the instrument
before such endorsement, has the right to recover compensation for any damage
that he may have suffered because of such endorsement against:

(a) The agent;

(b) The person to whom the instrument was directly transferred by the agent;

(c) A party or the drawee who paid the instrument to the agent directly or
through one or more endorsees for collection.

article if he is without knowledge that the endorsement does not bind the
principal:

(a) At the time he pays the principal or advises him of the receipt of payment;
or

(b) At the time he receives payment, if this is later, unless his lack of
knowledge is due to his failure to act in good faith or to exercise reasonable
care.

3. Furthermore, a party or the drawee who pays an instrument is not liable
under paragraph 1 of this article if, at the time he pays the instrument, he is
without knowledge that the endorsement does not bind the principal, unless his
lack of knowledge is due to his failure to act in good faith or to exercise
reasonable care.

4. Except as against the agent, the damages recoverable under paragraph 1 of
this article may not exceed the amount referred to in article 70 or article 71.

(b) The holder acquired the instrument by theft or forged the signature of the
payee or an endorsee, or participated in the theft or the forgery.

SECTION  2. - LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES
========================================

A. - GENERAL PROVISIONS
=======================

ARTICLE  33
-----------

1. Subject to the provisions of articles 34 and 36, a person is not liable on
an instrument unless he signs it.

2. A person who signs an instrument in a name which is not his own is liable as
if he had signed it in his own name.

ARTICLE  34
-----------

A forged signature on an instrument does not impose any liability on the person
whose signature was forged. However, if he consents to be bound by the forged
signature or represents that it is his own, he is liable as if he had signed
the instrument himself.

ARTICLE  35
-----------

1. If an instrument is materially altered:

(a) A party who signs it after the material alteration is liable according to
the terms of the altered text;

material alteration unless the contrary is proved.

3. Any alteration is material which modifies the written undertaking on the
instrument of any party in any respect.

2. The signature of an agent placed by him on an instrument with the authority
of his principal and showing on the instrument that he is signing in a
representative capacity for that named principal, or the signature of a
principal placed on the instrument by an agent with his authority, imposes
liability on the principal and not on the agent.

3. A signature placed on an instrument by a person as agent but who lacks
authority to sign or exceeds his authority, or by an agent who has authority to
sign but who does not show on the instrument that he is signing in a
representative capacity for a named person, or who shows on the instrument that
he is signing in a representative capacity but does not name the person whom he
represents, imposes liability on the person signing and not on the person whom
he purports to represent.

4. The question whether a signature was placed on the instrument in a
representative capacity may be determined only by reference to what appears on
the instrument.

5. A person who is liable pursuant to paragraph 3 of this article and who pays
the instrument has the same rights as the person for whom he purported to act
would have had if that person had paid the instrument.

ARTICLE  37
-----------

The order to pay contained in a bill does not of itself operate as an
assignment to the payee of funds made available for payment by the drawer with
the drawee.

B. - THE DRAWER
===============

ARTICLE  38
-----------

1. The drawer engages that upon dishonour of the bill by non-acceptance or by
non-payment, and upon any necessary protest, he will pay the bill to the
holder, or to any endorser or any endorser's guarantor who takes up and pays
the bill.

2. The drawer may exclude or limit his own liability for acceptance or for
payment by an express stipulation in the bill. Such a stipulation is effective
only with respect to the drawer. A stipulation excluding or limiting liability
for payment is effective only if another party is or becomes liable on the
bill.

C. - THE MAKER
==============

ARTICLE  39
-----------

1. The maker engages that he will pay the note in accordance with its terms to
the holder, or to any party who takes up and pays the note.

================================

ARTICLE  40
-----------

1. The drawee is not liable on a bill until he accepts it.

2. The acceptor engages that he will pay the bill in accordance with the terms
of his acceptance to the holder, or to any party who takes up and pays the
bill.

ARTICLE  41
-----------

(a) By the signature of the drawee accompanied by the word "accepted" or by
words of similar import; or

(b) By the signature alone of the drawee.

2. An acceptance may be written on the front or on the back of the bill.

ARTICLE  42
-----------

1. An incomplete bill which satisfies the requirements set out in paragraph 1
of article 1 may be accepted by the drawee before it has been signed by the
drawer, or while otherwise incomplete.

2. A bill may be accepted before, at or after maturity, or after it has been
dishonoured by non-acceptance or by non-payment.

3. If a bill drawn payable at a fixed period after sight, or a bill which must
be presented for acceptance before a specified date, is accepted, the acceptor
must indicate the date of his acceptance; failing such indication by the
acceptor, the drawer or the holder may insert the date of acceptance.

4. If a bill drawn payable at a fixed period after sight is dishonoured by
non-acceptance and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder is entitled
to have the acceptance dated as of the date on which the bill was dishonoured.

ARTICLE  43
-----------

1. An acceptance must be unqualified. An acceptance is qualified if it is
conditional or varies the terms of the bill.

2. If the drawee stipulates in the bill that his acceptance is subject to
qualification:

(a) He is nevertheless bound according to the terms of his qualified
acceptance;

(b) The bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance.

3. An acceptance relating to only a part of the sum payable is a qualified
acceptance. If the holder takes such an acceptance, the bill is dishonoured by
non-acceptance only as to the remaining part.

4. An acceptance indicating that payment will be made at a particular address
or by a particular agent is not a qualified acceptance, provided that:

(a) The place in which payment is to be made is not changed;

(b) The bill is not drawn payable by another agent.

E. - THE ENDORSER
=================

ARTICLE  44
-----------

1. The endorser engages that upon dishonour of the instrument by non-acceptance
or by non-payment, and upon any necessary protest, he will pay the instrument
to the holder, or to any subsequent endorser or any endorser's guarantor who
takes up and pays the instrument.

2. An endorser may exclude or limit his own liability by an express stipulation
in the instrument. Such a stipulation is effective only with respect to that
endorser.

F. - THE TRANSFEROR BY ENDORSEMENT OR BY MERE DELIVERY
======================================================

ARTICLE  45
-----------

1. Unless otherwise agreed, a person who transfers an instrument, by
endorsement and delivery or by mere delivery, represents to the holder to whom
he transfers the instrument that:

(a) The instrument does not bear any forged or unauthorized signature;

(b) The instrument has not been materially altered;

(c) At the time of transfer, he has no knowledge of any fact which would impair
the right of the transferee to payment of the instrument against the acceptor
of a bill or, in the case of an unaccepted bill, the drawer, or against the
maker of a note.

2. Liability of the transferor under paragraph 1 of this article is incurred
only if the transferee took the instrument without knowledge of the matter
giving rise to such liability.

3. If the transferor is liable under paragraph 1 of this article, the
transferee may recover, even before maturity, the amount paid by him to the
transferor, with interest calculated in accordance with article 70, against
return of the instrument.

G. - THE GUARANTOR
==================

ARTICLE  46
-----------

1. Payment of an instrument, whether or not it has been accepted, may be
guaranteed, as to the whole or part of its amount, for the account of a party
or the drawee. A guarantee may be given by any person, who may or may not
already be a party.

2. A guarantee must be written on the instrument or on a slip affixed thereto
("allonge").

3. A guarantee is expressed by the words "guaranteed", "aval", "good as aval"
or words of similar import, accompanied by the signature of the guarantor. For
the purposes of this Convention, the words "prior endorsements guaranteed" or
words of similar import do not constitute a guarantee.

4. A guarantee may be effected by a signature alone on the front of the
instrument. A signature alone on the front of the instrument, other than that
of the maker, the drawer or the drawee, is a guarantee.

5. A guarantor may specify the person for whom he has become guarantor. In the

signed the instrument before it was signed by the person for whom he is a
guarantor, or while the instrument was incomplete.

ARTICLE  47

paragraph 1 of article 30.

4. In respect of defences that may be raised by the person for whom he has
become a guarantor:

those defences which the person for whom he has become a guarantor may set up
against such holder under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of article 28;

(b) A guarantor who expresses his guarantee by the words "guaranteed", "payment
guaranteed" or "collection guaranteed", or words of similar import, may set up

article 30;

(c) A guarantor who expresses his guarantee by the words "aval" or "good as
aval" may set up against a protected holder only:

expresses its guarantee by a signature alone may set up against a protected
holder only the defences referred to in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.

discharges the party for whom he became guarantor of his liability on the
instrument to the extent of the amount paid.

2. The guarantor who pays the instrument may recover from the party for whom he
has become guarantor and from the parties who are liable on it to that party
the amount paid and any interest.

instrument that has been dishonoured.

with a named person for payment, by that named person; the declaration must be
to the effect that acceptance or payment is refused.

4. A declaration made in accordance with paragraph 3 of this article is a
protest for the purpose of this Convention.

----------

1. The holder, upon dishonour of an instrument by non-acceptance or by

recourse on the instrument against the party notified.

ARTICLE 65
----------

1. Notice of dishonour may be given in any form whatever and in any terms which
identify the instrument and state that it has been dishonoured. The return of
the dishonoured instrument is sufficient notice, provided it is accompanied by
a statement indicating that it has been dishonoured.

2. Notice of dishonour is duly given if it is communicated or sent to the party
to be notified by means appropriate in the circumstances, whether or not it is
received by that party.

delay ceases to operate, notice must be given with reasonable diligence.

2. Notice of dishonour is dispensed with:

(b) If the drawer, an endorser or a guarantor has expressly waived notice of
dishonour; such waiver:

benefits any holder;

that party but benefits any holder;

(iii) If made outside the instrument, binds only the party making it and
benefits only a holder in whose favour it was made;

(c) As regards the drawer of the bill, if the drawer and the drawee or the
acceptor are the same person.

ARTICLE 68
----------

If a person who is required to give notice of dishonour fails to give it to a
party who is entitled to receive it, he is liable for any damages which that
party may suffer from such failure, provided that such damages do not exceed

SECTION 4. - AMOUNT PAYABLE
===========================

ARTICLE 69
----------

1. The holder may exercise his rights on the instrument against any one party,

subject to a discount from the date of payment to the date of maturity,
calculated in accordance with paragraph 4 of this article;

(ii) Any expenses of protest and of the notices given by him.

2. The rate of interest shall be the rate that would be recoverable in legal
proceedings taken in the jurisdiction where the instrument is payable.

3. Nothing in paragraph 2 of this article prevents a court from awarding
damages or compensation for additional loss caused to the holder by reason of
delay in payment.

4. The discount shall be at the official rate (discount rate) or other similar
appropriate rate effective on the date when recourse is exercised at the place
where the holder has his principal place of business, or, if he does not have a

possession of it, the amount due pursuant to article 70 or article 71:

(a) At or after maturity; or

(b) Before maturity, upon dishonour by non-acceptance.

2. Payment before maturity other than under paragraph 1 (b) of this article
does not discharge the party making the payment of his liability on the
instrument except in respect of the person to whom payment was made.

3. A party is not discharged of liability if he pays a holder who is not a
protected holder, or a party who has taken up and paid the instrument, and
knows at the time of payment that the holder or that party acquired the
instrument by theft or forged the signature of the payee or an endorsee, or
participated in the theft or the forgery.

4. (a) A person receiving payment of an instrument must, unless agreed
otherwise, deliver:

(i) To the drawee making such payment, the instrument;

(ii) To any other person making such payment, the instrument, a receipted
account, and any protest.

(b) In the case of an instrument payable by instalments at successive dates,
the drawee or a party making a payment, other than payment of the last
instalment, may require that mention of such payment be made on the instrument
or on a slip affixed thereto ("allonge") and that a receipt therefor be given
to him.

(c) If an instrument payable by instalments at successive dates is dishonoured
by non-acceptance or by non-payment as to any of its instalments and a party,
upon dishonour, pays the instalment, the holder who receives such payment must
give the party a certified copy of the instrument and any necessary
authenticated protest in order to enable such party to exercise a right on the
instrument.

(d) The person from whom payment is demanded may withhold payment if the person
demanding payment does not deliver the instrument to him. Withholding payment
in these circumstances does not constitute dishonour by non-payment under
article 58.

(e) If payment is made but the person paying, other than the drawee, fails to
obtain the instrument, such person is discharged but the discharge cannot be
set up as a defence against a protected holder to whom the instrument has been
subsequently transferred.

----------

1. The holder is not obliged to take partial payment.

2. If the holder who is offered partial payment does not take it, the
instrument is dishonoured by non-payment.

his liability on the instrument to the extent of the amount paid;

amount unpaid.

than the acceptor, the maker or the guarantor of the drawee:

(a) The party making payment is discharged of his liability on the instrument
to the extent of the amount paid;

(b) The holder must give such party a certified copy of the instrument and any
necessary authenticated protest in order to enable such party to exercise a
right on the instrument.

5. The drawee or a party making partial payment may require that mention of
such payment be made on the instrument and that a receipt therefor be given to
him.

6. If the balance is paid, the person who receives it and who is in possession
of the instrument must deliver to the payor the receipted instrument and any
authenticated protest.

ARTICLE 74
----------

1. The holder may refuse to take payment at a place other than the place where
the instrument was presented for payment in accordance with article 55.

2. In such case if payment is not made at the place where the instrument was
presented for payment in accordance with article 55, the instrument is
considered to be dishonoured by non-payment.

ARTICLE 75
----------

1. An instrument must be paid in the currency in which the sum payable is
expressed.

2. If the sum payable is expressed in a monetary unit of account within the
meaning of subparagraph (l) of article 5 and the monetary unit of account is
transferable between the person making payment and the person receiving it,
then, unless the instrument specifies a currency of payment, payment shall be
made by transfer of monetary units of account. If the monetary unit of account
is not transferable between those persons, payment shall be made in the
currency specified in the instrument or, if no such currency is specified, in
the currency of the place of payment.

3. The drawer or the maker may indicate in the instrument that it must be paid
in a specified currency other than the currency in which the sum payable is
expressed. In that case:

(a) The instrument must be paid in the currency so specified;

(b) The amount payable is to be calculated according to the rate of exchange
indicated in the instrument. Failing such indication, the amount payable is to
be calculated according to the rate of exchange for sight drafts (or, if there
is no such rate, according to the appropriate established rate of exchange) on
the date of maturity:

(i) Ruling at the place where the instrument must be presented for payment in
accordance with subparagraph (g) of article 55, if the specified currency is
that of that place (local currency); or

(ii) If the specified currency is not that of that place, according to the
usages of the place where the instrument must be presented for payment in
accordance with subparagraph (g) of article 55;

(c) If such an instrument is dishonoured by non-acceptance, the amount payable
is to be calculated:

(i) If the rate of exchange is indicated in the instrument, according to that
rate;

(ii) If no rate of exchange is indicated in the instrument, at the option of
the holder, according to the rate of exchange ruling on the date of dishonour
or on the date of actual payment;

(d) If such an instrument is dishonoured by non-payment, the amount payable is
to be calculated:

(i) If the rate of exchange is indicated in the instrument, according to that
rate;

(ii) If no rate of exchange is indicated in the instrument, at the option of
the holder, according to the rate of exchange ruling on the date of maturity or
on the date of actual payment.

4. Nothing in this article prevents a court from awarding damages for loss
caused to the holder by reason of fluctuations in rates of exchange if such
loss is caused by dishonour for non-acceptance or by non-payment.

5. The rate of exchange ruling at a certain date is the rate of exchange
ruling, at the option of the holder, at the place where the instrument must be
presented for payment in accordance with subparagraph (g) of article 55 or at
the place of actual payment.

ARTICLE 76
----------

1. Nothing in this Convention prevents a Contracting State from enforcing
exchange control regulations applicable in its territory and its provisions
relating to the protection of its currency, including regulations which it is
bound to apply by virtue of international agreements to which it is a party.

2.

(a) If, by virtue of the application of paragraph 1 of this article, an
instrument drawn in a currency which is not that of the place of payment must
be paid in local currency, the amount payable is to be calculated according to
the rate of exchange for sight drafts (or, if there is no such rate, according
to the appropriate established rate of exchange) on the date of presentment
ruling at the place where the instrument must be presented for payment in
accordance with subparagraph (g) of article 55.

(b) (i) If such an instrument is dishonoured by non-acceptance, the amount
payable is to be calculated, at the option of the holder, at the rate of
exchange ruling on the date of dishonour or on the date of actual payment.

(ii) If such an instrument is dishonoured by non-payment, the amount is to be
calculated, at the option of the holder, according to the rate of exchange
ruling on the date of presentment or on the date of actual payment.

(iii) Paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 75 are applicable where appropriate.

SECTION 2. - DISCHARGE OF OTHER PARTIES
=======================================

ARTICLE 77
----------

instrument, any party who has a right on the instrument against him is
discharged to the same extent.

2. Payment by the drawee of the whole or a part of the amount of a bill to the
holder, or to any party who takes up and pays the bill, discharges all parties
of their liability to the same extent, except where the drawee pays a holder
who is not a protected holder, or a party who has taken up and paid the bill,
and knows at the time of payment that the holder or that party acquired the
bill by theft or forged the signature of the payee or an endorsee, or
participated in the theft or the forgery.

CHAPTER VII. - LOST INSTRUMENTS
*******************************

ARTICLE 78
----------

1. If an instrument is lost, whether by destruction, theft or otherwise, the
person who lost the instrument has, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of
this article, the same right to payment which he would have had if he had been
in possession of the instrument. The party from whom payment is claimed cannot
set up as a defence against liability on the instrument the fact that the
person claiming payment is not in possession of the instrument.

2.

(a) The person claiming payment of a lost instrument must state in writing to
the party from whom he claims payment:

(i) The elements of the lost instrument pertaining to the requirements set

would have had a right to payment from the party from whom payment is claimed;

(iii) The facts which prevent production of the instrument.

(b) The party from whom payment of a lost instrument is claimed may require the
person claiming payment to give security in order to indemnify him for any loss
which he may suffer by reason of the subsequent payment of the lost instrument.

(c) The nature of the security and its terms are to be determined by agreement
between the person claiming payment and the party from whom payment is claimed.
Failing such an agreement, the court may determine whether security is called
for and, if so, the nature of the security and its terms.

(d) If the security cannot be given, the court may order the party from whom
payment is claimed to deposit the sum of the lost instrument, and any interest
and expenses which may be claimed under article 70 or article 71, with the
court or any other competent authority or institution, and may determine the
duration of such deposit. Such deposit is to be considered as payment to the
person claiming payment.

ARTICLE 79
----------

1. A party who has paid a lost instrument and to whom the instrument is
subsequently presented for payment by another person must give notice of such
presentment to the person whom he paid.

2. Such notice must be given on the day the instrument is presented or on one
of the two business days which follow and must state the name of the person
presenting the instrument and the date and place of presentment.

3. Failure to give notice renders the party who has paid the lost instrument
liable for any damages which the person whom he paid may suffer from such
failure, provided that the damages do not exceed the amount referred to in
article 70 or article 71.

4. Delay in giving notice is excused when the delay is caused by circumstances
which are beyond the control of the person who has paid the lost instrument and
which he could neither avoid nor overcome. When the cause of the delay ceases
to operate, notice must be given with reasonable diligence.

5. Notice is dispensed with when the cause of delay in giving notice continues
to operate beyond thirty days after the last day on which it should have been
given.

ARTICLE 80
----------

1. A party who has paid a lost instrument in accordance with the provisions of
article 78 and who is subsequently required to, and does, pay the instrument,
or who, by reason of the loss of the instrument, then loses his right to
recover from any party liable to him, has the right:

(a) If security was given, to realize the security; or

(b) If an amount was deposited with the court or other competent authority or
institution, to reclaim the amount so deposited.

2. The person who has given security in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 2 (b) of article 78 is entitled to obtain release of the security
when the party for whose benefit the security was given is no longer at risk to
suffer loss because of the fact that the instrument is lost.

ARTICLE 81
----------

For the purpose of making protest for dishonour by non-payment, a person
claiming payment of a lost instrument may use a written statement that
satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 (a) of article 78.

ARTICLE 82
----------

A person receiving payment of a lost instrument in accordance with article 78
must deliver to the party paying the written statement required under
paragraph 2 (a) of article 78, receipted by him, and any protest and a
receipted account.

ARTICLE 83
----------

1. A party who pays a lost instrument in accordance with article 78 has the
same rights which he would have had if he had been in possession of the
instrument.

2. Such party may exercise his rights only if he is in possession of the
receipted written statement referred to in article 82.

CHAPTER VIII. - LIMITATION (PRESCRIPTION)
*****************************************

ARTICLE 84
----------

1. A right of action arising on an instrument may no longer be exercised after
four years have elapsed:

(a) Against the maker, or his guarantor, of a note payable on demand, from the
date of the note;

(b) Against the acceptor or the maker or their guarantor of an instrument
payable at a definite time, from the date of maturity;

(c) Against the guarantor of the drawee of a bill payable at a definite time,

ANNEX - EXPLANATORY NOTE BY THE UNCITRAL SECRETARIAT ON THE UNITED NATIONS
CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL PROMISSORY
NOTES *[NOTE]
==============================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

1. The United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and
International Promissory Notes is the culmination of over fifteen years of work
by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). It was
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations under recommendation of
the Sixth (Legal) Committee on 9 December 1988.

2. The Convention presents, for optional use in international transactions, a
modern, comprehensive set of rules for international bills of exchange and
international promissory notes that satisfy its requisites of form. The text of
the Convention reflects a deliberate policy to minimize departures from the
content of the two existing principal legal systems, preserving, where
possible, the rules on which those systems concur. Where conflicts exist,
requiring selection of one system's rule or a compromise solution, the
Convention introduces a number of novel provisions. Another group of new rules
are the result of special efforts to have the Convention respond to modern
commercial needs and banking and financial market practices.

3. The Convention is divided into nine chapters. Chapter one deals with the
sphere of application of the Convention and the form of the instrument covered
by it. Chapter two contains definitions and other general provisions, including
rules on the interpretation of various formal requirements. Chapter three
addresses questions relating to the transfer of an instrument. The fourth
chapter covers the rights and liabilities of parties to, and holders of, an
instrument. The fifth chapter addresses issues relating to presentment of an
instrument, dishonour by non-acceptance or non-payment, and the conditions
precedent to parties' rights of recourse. The sixth chapter deals with the
discharge of liability on an instrument. Chapters seven and eight deal with
lost instruments and limitation of actions (prescription). Lastly, the final
provisions are found in chapter nine.

A. - BACKGROUND TO THE CONVENTION
---------------------------------

4. The United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and
International Promissory Notes is the result of a movement to establish a
modern, self-contained international legal regime that would apply world-wide.

5. At its very first session held in 1968, UNCITRAL decided that, along with
international sale of goods and international commercial arbitration,
international payments should be given priority in its programme of future
work. It was thought to be necessary to support the continued use of bills of
exchange and promissory notes for international payments despite the emergence
of new payment mechanisms. The new practices and techniques, it was thought,
would not displace the more conventional usages, especially in the important
role of financing international transactions.

7. The first step taken by UNCITRAL was to consult with the International
Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) which had previously
addressed the subject of unification of the law relating to negotiable
instruments. At the request of the Commission, UNIDROIT prepared a preliminary
report on the possibilities of extending the unification of the law of bills of
exchange and cheques. In the light of this report the Commission considered
three possible methods of promoting unification. These were, firstly:
encouraging a wider acceptance of the Geneva Conventions of 1930 and 1931;
secondly, revising the Geneva Conventions of 1930 and 1931 with a view to
making them more acceptable to countries following the Anglo-American system;
and, lastly, creating a new negotiable instruments law. The discussions showed
that the method most likely to succeed would be the creation of a new
negotiable instruments law. It was felt that merely revising the Geneva
Conventions would not make them acceptable to common law States.

8. Before resolving to begin the preparation of a new negotiable instruments
law the Commission decided to conduct an extensive enquiry to obtain the views
and suggestions of Governments, banks and trading institutions. The Commission
prepared and distributed an elaborate questionnaire and analysed the replies
given by respondents regarding the present methods and practice for making and
receiving international payments, the problems encountered in settling
international transactions by means of negotiable instruments and the possible
extent of new uniform law. From this analysis it became clear that the only
viable approach would be to prepare a new set of rules that would be applicable
to a special negotiable instrument for optional use in international
transactions.

9. The secretariat of UNCITRAL first prepared a draft Uniform Law on
International Bills of Exchange and a Commentary. The draft was later extended
to include international promissory notes. The draft was revised over fourteen
sessions of the Working Group on International Negotiable Instruments and three
sessions of the Commission itself. At the fifth session of the Working Group it
was decided to set forth the new provisions in the form of a convention rather
than a uniform law.

10. The Convention as adopted aims at facilitating international trade and
finance. Throughout the legislative process, attention was constantly given to
the comments and observations of Governments, banks, trading and other
interested circles.

11. The Convention does not purport to replace existing domestic legislation.
It presents for optional use in international transactions a comprehensive body
of rules that are theoretically and practically sound, being derived from a
coherent set of principles fundamental to all known laws governing bills of
exchange and promissory notes.

B. - SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CONVENTION
=======================================

1. SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND FORM OF THE INSTRUMENT
--------------------------------------------------

12. The Convention applies only to international bills of exchange and
international promissory notes when they comply with certain requisites of
form. In particular, the Convention applies only to international instruments
that bear in both their heading and their text the words "International bill of
exchange (UNCITRAL Convention)" or "International promissory note (UNCITRAL
Convention)". The use of an instrument governed by the Convention is thus
entirely optional. Ratification or accession by a State does not subject all
international instruments issued in that State to the legal regime of the
Convention but merely opens the door for bankers and merchants to opt for this
new legal regime if they deem it preferable in their professional judgment.

13. The Convention provides its own definitions of the terms "bill of exchange"
and "promissory note" and explicitly states the conditions on which a bill of
exchange or promissory note is considered to be international. According to the
Convention, a bill of exchange is a written instrument which: a) contains an
unconditional order whereby the drawer directs the drawee to pay a definite sum
of money to the payee or to its order; b) is payable on demand or at a definite
time; c) is dated; and d) is signed by the drawer. A promissory note is a
written instrument which: a) contains an unconditional promise whereby the
maker undertakes to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to its order;
b) is payable on demand or at a definite time; c) is dated; d) is signed by the
maker.

14. In order to qualify as an international bill under the Convention a bill of
exchange must specify at least two of the places listed in article 2(1) of the
Convention, and any two so specified places must be situated in different
States. The places listed are: the place where the bill is drawn, the place
indicated next to the signature of the drawer, the place indicated next to the
name of the drawee, the place indicated next to the name of the payee, and the
place of payment. In its turn an international promissory note must specify at
least two of the places listed in article 2(2) of the Convention, whereby any
two so specified places must be situated in different States. The places listed
are: the place where the note is made, the place indicated next to the
signature of the maker, the place indicated next to the name of the payee, and
the place of payment.

15. There is one last requirement that an instrument fulfilling the above
criteria must meet in order to qualify as an international instrument under the
Convention: a certain place of importance situated in a State that is a party
to the Convention must also be specified in the instrument. In the case of a
bill of exchange, this will either be the place of drawing or the place of
payment. In the case of a promissory note, this will be the place of payment. A
State may however declare, in becoming a party to the Convention, that its
courts will apply the Convention only if both the place indicated in the
instrument where the bill is drawn, or the note is made, and the place of
payment indicated in the instrument are situated in Contracting States. This is
the only reservation permitted under the Convention.

16. The legal rules provided by the Convention will apply even where there has
been an incorrect or false statement in respect of a place indicated in an
instrument. This rule continues the common policy of domestic bills of exchange
laws to the effect that instruments are to be judged only by their texts - the
material appearing on their faces. It may also be justified on the pragmatic
ground that to have provided otherwise could have cast doubts on the
applicability of the rules and eventually impaired the free circulation of
international bills and notes. The Convention leaves to domestic laws the
question of sanctions that may be imposed where such a false or incorrect
statement has been made in an instrument.

17. Following the trend established by some domestic legal systems, the
Convention does not allow negotiable instruments to be drawn on two or more
drawees or to be issued payable to bearer. Neither restriction is significant
in practice: nothing prevents a payee or special endorsee from making an
instrument covered by the Convention payable to bearer by endorsing it in
blank; and multiple-drawee instruments have proved to be quite rare and a
source of confusion when they do occur.

18. The United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and
International Promissory Notes does not address international cheques. These
have been the subject of a parallel project by UNCITRAL, the latest result of
which is a draft Convention. The decision to draw up the uniform rules on
international bills of exchange and international promissory notes and the
uniform rules on international cheques as separate legal texts and not as a
consolidated text was taken mainly to accommodate the civil law jurisdictions
which have traditionally considered bills of exchange and cheques as separate
instruments fulfilling separate functions. Work on the draft Convention on
International Cheques was suspended in 1984, partly due to the fact that
cheques were seen to play a less important role in international payments.

2. INTERPRETATION OF THE CONVENTION
-----------------------------------

19. An international body of rules aiming at the unification of a certain field
of law can fulfil its ultimate purpose only if it is interpreted in a sensible
and consistent manner by all legal systems applying it. Like many other
international legal texts, the Convention requires courts that interpret it to
have regard for its international character and for the need to promote
uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international
transactions.

20. The goal of uniform interpretation is furthered by a scheme called CLOUT
(Case law on UNCITRAL texts) under which the secretariat publishes abstracts of
court decisions or arbitral awards that apply any of the Conventions or Model
Laws that emanate from the work of UNCITRAL.

3. THE CONCEPTS OF "HOLDER" AND "PROTECTED HOLDER"
--------------------------------------------------

21. In its desire to win commercial acceptance and free circulation of its
instruments in international commerce, the Convention firmly upholds the
principle of negotiability.

22. When dealing with the rights of the holder of an instrument and the
limitations of those rights by the claims and defences of others, the drafters
of the Convention were obliged to make a selection between the radically
distinct, and yet justifiable, approaches of the civil and common law systems.
The solution chosen was a pragmatic two-tier system that distinguishes between
a mere holder and a "protected holder". The rights of the protected holder are
freed from the claims and defences of other persons to a greater extent than
are the rights vested in the ordinary holder.

23. The solution, although similar in technique to the scheme found in common
law jurisdictions, is in fact a compromise since it borrows from both the civil
and common law approaches. For instance, under the Convention, a person is not
prevented from becoming a holder by the fact that the instrument was obtained
under circumstances, including incapacity or fraud, duress or mistake of any
kind, that would give rise to a claim to, or a defence against liability on,
the instrument. That regime resembles the civil law much more than the common
law on the issue. Perhaps most important, a person who is in possession of an
instrument as an endorsee, or on which the last endorsement is in blank, and on
which there appears an uninterrupted series of endorsements, can be awarded the
protected holder status even though any endorsement appearing on the instrument
was forged or signed by an agent without authority.

24. The Convention enlarges the protection of protected holders by omitting any
requirement that a protected holder has given value for the instrument.
Furthermore, the test that one must meet in order to attain the protected
holder status is easily passed, and every holder is presumed to be a protected
holder unless the contrary is proved.

25. Although not so well protected as a protected holder, a mere holder is not
totally unprotected from adverse claims and defences. The holder in fact
derives an appreciable degree of protection from the rules contained in the
Convention that allow certain types of claims or defences only if the holder
had knowledge of them or if it was involved in a fraud or theft concerning the
instrument.

26. Under the Convention, the transfer of an instrument by a protected holder
vests in any subsequent holder the rights to and on the instrument that the
protected holder had. This so-called "shelter rule" again favours the
negotiability of instruments. Its main value is to the protected holder as
transferor since it preserves the value it invested in taking the instrument in
the first place. It is not possible, however, for a holder who is not entitled
to any protection to simply "wash" an instrument by transferring it to a
protected holder and then taking it back.

4. TRANSFER WARRANTIES
----------------------

27. Article 45 of the Convention brings light to an area that is dealt with in
different ways in the existing principal legal systems. Moreover, it brings
into the realm of negotiable instruments law a principle that is left to the
general law of sales or contracts in civil law jurisdictions.

28. The rule provides that, unless otherwise agreed, a person who transfers an
instrument, by endorsement and delivery or by mere delivery, makes certain
implied representations concerning the quality of the instrument and its lack
of knowledge of any fact which could impair the right of the transferee to
payment of the instrument against the primary obligor upon it. These
representations as to quality consist of a warranty that the instrument does
not bear any forged or unauthorized signature, and has not been materially
altered. Liability of the transferor under the article is incurred only if the
transferee took the instrument without knowledge of the matter giving rise to
such liability.

29. The liability provided for here is in part weaker and in part stronger than
the one incurred by an endorser. It is weaker in that it does not guarantee
payment of the instrument and is available only for the benefit of the
immediate transferee; it is stronger in that a transferee may recover, even
before maturity, the amount paid by it to the transferor, independently of any
presentment, dishonour or protest.

5. GUARANTEES AND AVALS
-----------------------

30. The provisions of the Convention dealing with the liability of the
guarantor comprise one of the most attractive features of the text. The
Convention subtly recognizes both the aval, or the Geneva type of guarantee,
and the other, weaker type of guarantee known in common law jurisdictions.

31. Article 46 of the Convention provides that payment of an instrument may be
guaranteed either before or after acceptance, as to the whole or part of its
amount, for the account of a party or the drawee. A guarantee may be given by
any person, who may or may not already be a party. A guarantee is expressed by
the words "guaranteed", "aval", "good as aval" or words of similar import,
accompanied by the signature of the guarantor, or effected by a signature alone
on the front of an instrument. In fact, any signature alone on the front of an
instrument, other than that of the maker, the drawer or the drawee, is a
guarantee. The words by which a guarantee is expressed determine the nature of
the obligation undertaken by the guarantor. In the absence of some notation
specifying the party for whom a guarantee is given, the rules of the Convention
interpret it as a guarantee for the drawee, acceptor or maker.

32. The crucial difference between the two types of guarantees recognized by
the Convention ultimately lies in the defences that a guarantor may set up
against a holder or a protected holder. They differ, depending upon the words
used to express the guarantee (i.e. "guaranteed" produces a different result
than "aval") and whether the guarantor is a financial institution. A guarantor
that is a bank or other financial institution and which expresses its guarantee
by a signature alone is considered to have contracted the stronger type of
guarantee or "aval"; a guarantor that is not a bank or other financial
institution and which does the same is considered to have contracted the weaker
type of guarantee.

6. OTHER NOVEL PROVISIONS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE
-------------------------------------------------

33. The Convention introduces a number of provisions which ought to be of
benefit in modern commercial practice. In this, the Convention reflects its
recent development, while many of the rules found in the negotiable instruments
laws of the world have not kept pace with changing business practices. The
following novel provisions are of note:

(a) Instruments with floating rates of interest

34. The Convention permits instruments to bear interest at a variable rate
without loss of negotiability. Where the technique used is in accordance with
the requirements of the Convention, the sum payable is deemed to be a definite
sum despite the variable rate of interest. For the protection of debtors, the
Convention permits rates to vary only in accordance with provisions stipulated
in the instrument and in relation to one or more reference rates published or
otherwise publicly available. As a further protection, the reference may not be
subject, directly or indirectly, to unilateral determination by a person who is
named in the instrument at the time the bill is drawn or the note is made,
unless the person is named only in the reference rate provisions. There may
also be stipulated limits to the permissible variations in the interest rate.

(b) Rates of exchange outside instrument

35. The Convention also permits reference to a rate of foreign exchange outside
an instrument, e.g. a bank exchange rate in a particular place at a certain
date, in calculating the amount payable under the instrument. Here as well, the
sum payable under an instrument is deemed to be a definite sum even though the
instrument states that it is to be paid according to a rate of exchange
indicated in the instrument or to be determined as directed by the instrument.

(c) Instruments payable in instalments

36. The Convention allows instruments that are subject to it to be made payable
by instalments at successive dates. They may also contain an "acceleration
clause", i.e. a stipulation that upon default in payment of any instalment the
entire unpaid balance becomes immediately due.

(d) Instruments denominated and payable in a monetary unit of account

37. The Convention creates a regime in which instruments may be made payable in
units of value other than the official currencies of nation States. This is
accomplished by the definition of the terms "money" and "currency", which, in
addition to referring to normal mediums of exchange adopted by Governments as
their official currency, include a monetary unit of account which is
established by an intergovernmental institution or by agreement between two or
more States, e.g. the Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary
Fund, the European Currency Unit (ECU) and the Unit of Account of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (UAPTA). The
Convention also contains a useful new rule selecting a currency of payment
where the monetary unit of account in which an instrument is payable is not
transferable between the person liable to pay the instrument and the person
receiving the payment.

(e) Foreign currency obligations

38. The Convention attempts to avoid the controversies that can arise with
instruments drawn or made in a currency other than that of the place where
payment is to be made. The text provides that, except for the cases where the
drawer or maker of an instrument has indicated that it must be paid in a
specified currency other than the currency in which the sum payable is
expressed, payment must be made in the latter currency. Where applicable, this
rule will prevent a debtor from discharging its obligation by payment in
another currency, e.g. a local one. It should be of assistance by providing
greater certainty in cases involving currency value fluctuations.

39. In an effort to avoid infringing on exchange control regulations and other
provisions relating to the protection of the currency of a State, the
Convention provides a number of modifying rules to apply in exceptional
circumstances.

(f) Signature not in handwriting

40. Here as well the Convention attempts to adapt the law to new technology by
providing that the word "signature" includes not only a handwritten signature,
but also a facsimile or an equivalent authentication effected by any other
means.

(g) Rules on lost instruments

41. New rules are provided concerning lost instruments. In particular, a party
from whom payment of a lost instrument is claimed may require the person
claiming payment to give security in order to indemnify it for any loss which
it may suffer by reason of the subsequent payment of the lost instrument.

(h) Short form of protest

42. The Convention relaxes the highly precise rules which are found in common
law jurisdictions on protest. It also provides new common rules for Geneva
States that lack regulation concerning the procedures for effecting protest.
Under the new regime, unless an instrument stipulates that protest must be
made, protest may be replaced by a declaration written on the instrument and
signed and dated by the drawee or the acceptor or the maker, or, in the case of
an instrument domiciled with a named person for payment, by that named person.
The declaration must be to the effect that acceptance or payment is refused.
The Convention also extends to four business days the period that is usually
allowed to make protest.

(i) Uniform period of prescription

43. The Convention provides a single period of prescription or limitation of
actions. It is set at four years for almost all actions arising on an
instrument under the Convention. The only exception is that, where a party pays
an instrument on which another was primarily liable, the party's action for
reimbursement (recourse) is barred after one year.

(j) Drawing of instruments "without recourse"

44. The Convention contains a rule that should facilitate the practice of
forfaiting. Under the new rule, the drawer of a bill may exclude or limit its
own liability for acceptance or for payment by an express stipulation on the
bill, e.g. by drawing the bill "without recourse". This stipulation will be
effective only if another party is or becomes liable on the bill.

7. FINAL CLAUSES
----------------

45. The final clauses contain the usual provisions designating the
Secretary-General of the United Nations as depositary for the Convention. The
Convention was open for signature until 30 June 1990 and remains subject to
ratification, acceptance or approval by the signatory States. It is open for
accession by all States which are not signatory States as from the date it was
open for signature. According to article 89(1), the Convention enters into
force on the first day of the month following the expiration of twelve months
after the date of deposit of the tenth instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession.

46. The Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts of the
Convention are equally authentic. The final clauses also contain provisions
dealing with the implementation of the Convention in States having two or more
territorial units where different legal systems apply.

NOTES
=====

*[NOTE]
-------

This note has been prepared by the secretariat of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for informational purposes only; it is
not an official commentary on the Convention. Commentaries prepared by the
secretariat on earlier drafts of the Convention appear in A/CN.9/213
(reproduced in UNCITRAL Yearbook, vol. XIII-1982) and A/CN.9/67 (reproduced in
UNCITRAL Yearbook, vol. III-1972). 6. From the outset the work undertaken by
UNCITRAL in this area consisted of finding ways to overcome the great many
disparities between the various negotiable instruments laws of the world.
Previous attempts at unifying the law of negotiable instruments had brought
results only in a limited region or among countries of the same legal
tradition. For instance, the efforts undertaken at the Hague in 1910 and 1912
and under the League of Nations in 1930 and 1931 culminating in the adoption of
the Geneva Uniform Laws for Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes and Cheques had
resulted in the harmonization of the negotiable instruments laws of only part
of the civil law world and, on the common law side, a similar harmonization had
flowed from the issuance of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 of the United
