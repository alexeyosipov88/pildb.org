12 October 1929 as amended by the Protocol done at The Hague on 28 September
1955,

CHAPTER I - AMENDMENTS TO THE CONVENTION
========================================

ARTICLE I
---------

The Convention which the provisions of the present Chapter modify is the Warsaw
Convention as amended at The Hague in 1955.

ARTICLE II
----------

.Article 22 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:-

  "Article 22

  1. In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger
  is limited to the sum of 16 600 Special Drawing Rights. Where, in accordance
  with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the
  form of periodic payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments
  shall not exceed this limit. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier
  and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.

  2.

    (a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of
    the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per
    kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when
    the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of
    interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the
    case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not
    exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than
    the passenger's or consignor's actual interest in delivery at destination.

    (b) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or
    cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into
    consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is
    limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages
    concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the
    registered baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the
    value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air
    waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken
    into consideration in determining the limit of liability.

  3. As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the
  liability of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per
  passenger.

  4. The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from
  awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of
  the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the
  plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the
  damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation,
  does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the
  plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence
  causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is
  later.

  5. The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article
  shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the
  International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies
  shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of
  such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the
  judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing
  Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International
  Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation
  applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the
  judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national
  currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party
  which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated
  in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party.

  Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International
  Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions
  of paragraphs 1, 2(a) and 3 of Article 22 may at the time of ratification or
  accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of
  the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of
  250 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article
  22; 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 2(a) of
  Article 22; and 5 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph
  3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half
  milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be
  converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The
  conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to
  the law of the State concerned."
