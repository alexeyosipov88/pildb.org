VALUES(12, 'CONVENTION ON JURISDICTION, APPLICABLE LAW AND RECOGNITION OF DECREES RELATING TO ADOPTIONS
(Concluded November 15, 1965) 
(In accordance with its Article 23, this Convention ceased to have effect on 23 October 2008)                    
 
The States signatory to the present Convention,
Desiring to establish common provisions on jurisdiction, applicable law and recognition of decrees relating to adoption,
Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions:
 
Article 1
The present Convention applies to an adoption between:
on the one hand, a person who, possessing the nationality of one of the Contracting States, has his habitual residence within one of these States, or spouses each of whom, possessing the nationality of one of the Contracting States, has his or her habitual residence within one of these States, and
on the other hand, a child who has not attained the age of eighteen years at the time when the application for adoption is made and has not been married and who, possessing the nationality of one of the Contracting States, has his habitual residence within one of these States.
Article 2
The present Convention shall not apply where -
a) the adopters neither possess the same nationality nor have their habitual residence in the same Contracting State;
b) the adopter or adopters and the child, all possessing the same nationality, habitually reside in the State of which they are nationals;
c) an adoption is not granted by an authority having jurisdiction under Article 3.
Article 3
Jurisdiction to grant an adoption is vested in -
a) the authorities of the State where the adopter habitually resides or, in the case of an adoption by spouses, the authorities of the State in which both habitually reside;
b) the authorities of the State of which the adopter is a national or, in the case of an adoption by spouses, the authorities of the State of which both are nationals.
The conditions relating to habitual residence and nationality must be fulfilled both at the time when the application for adoption is made and at the time when the adoption is granted.
Article 4
The authorities who have jurisdiction under the first paragraph of Article 3 shall, subject to the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 5, apply their internal law to the conditions governing an adoption.
Nevertheless, an authority having jurisdiction by virtue of habitual residence shall respect any provision prohibiting adoption contained in the national law of the adopter or, in the case of an adoption by spouses, any such provision of their common national law, if such a prohibition has been referred to in a declaration of the kind contemplated in Article 13.
Article 5
The authorities who have jurisdiction under the first paragraph of Article 3 shall apply the national law of the child relating to consents and consultations, other than those with respect to an adopter, his family or his or her spouse.
If according to the said law the child or a member of his family must appear in person before the authority granting the adoption, the authority shall, if the person concerned is not habitually resident in the State of that authority, proceed, where appropriate, by means of a commission rogatoire.
Article 6
The authorities referred to in the first paragraph of Article 3 shall not grant an adoption unless it will be in the interest of the child. Before granting an adoption they shall carry out, through the agency of the appropriate local authorities, a thorough inquiry relating to the adopter or adopters, the child and his family. As far as possible, this inquiry shall be carried out in co-operation with public or private organisations qualified in the field of inter-country adoptions and the help of social workers having special training or having particular experience concerning the problems of adoption.
The authorities of all Contracting States shall promptly give all the assistance requested for the purposes of an adoption governed by the present Convention; for this purpose the authorities may communicate directly with each other.
Each Contracting State may designate one or more authorities empowered to communicate in accordance with the preceding paragraph.
Article 7
Jurisdiction to annul or to revoke an adoption governed by the present Convention shall be vested in -
a) the authorities of the Contracting State in which the person adopted habitually resides at the time when the application to annul or to revoke the adoption is made;
b) the authorities of the State in which at that time the adopter habitually resides or, in the case of an adoption by spouses, both of them habitually reside;
c) the authorities of the State which granted the adoption.
An adoption may be annulled -
a) on any ground permitted by the internal law of the State which granted the adoption; or
b) in accordance with the national law of the adopter or adopters at the time when that adoption was granted in cases where the application to annul is based on failure to comply with a prohibition to which the second paragraph of Article 4 applies; or
c) in accordance with the national law of the person adopted at the time when the adoption was granted in cases where the application to annul is based on failure to obtain a consent required by that law.
An adoption may be revoked in accordance with the internal law of the authority exercising jurisdiction.
Article 8
Every adoption governed by the present Convention and granted by an authority having jurisdiction under the first paragraph of Article 3 shall be recognised without further formality in all Contracting States.
Every decision annulling or revoking an adoption granted by an authority having jurisdiction under Article 7 shall be recognised without further formality in all Contracting States.
If any question arises in a Contracting State with respect to the recognition of such an adoption or decision, the authorities of that State, in considering the jurisdiction of the authority which granted the adoption or which gave the decision, shall be bound by the findings of fact on which that authority based its jurisdiction.
Article 9
When an authority having jurisdiction under the first paragraph of Article 3 has granted an adoption, it shall notify this fact to the other State, if any, the authorities of which would have been empowered to grant an adoption under that Article, to the State of which the child is a national and to the Contracting State where the child was born.
When an authority having jurisdiction under the first paragraph of Article 7 has annulled or revoked an adoption, it shall notify this fact to the State the authority of which had granted the adoption, to the State of which the child is a national and to the Contracting State where the child was born.
Article 10
For the purposes of the present Convention, an adopter or a child who is stateless or whose nationality is unknown, is deemed to have the nationality of the State of his habitual residence.
Article 11
For the purposes of the present Convention if in the State of which either an adopter or a child is a national, there is more than one legal system in force, references to the internal law or to the authorities of the State of which a person is a national shall be construed as references to the law or to the authorities determined by the rules in force in that State or, if there are no such rules, to the law or to authorities of that system with which the person concerned is most closely connected.
Article 12
The present Convention does not affect provisions of other Conventions relating to adoption binding Contracting States at the moment of its entry into force.
Article 13
Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, with a view to the application of the second paragraph of Article 4, make a declaration specifying the provisions of its internal law prohibiting adoptions founded upon -
a) the existence of descendants of the adopter or adopters;
b) the fact that a single person is applying to adopt;
c) the existence of a blood relationship between an adopter and the child;
d) the existence of a previous adoption of the child by other persons;
e) the requirement of a difference in age between adopter or adopters and the child;
f)  the age of the adopter or adopters and that of the child;
g) the fact that the child does not reside with the adopter or adopters.
Such declarations may be revoked at any time. The revocation shall be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.
Any declaration which has been revoked shall cease to have effect on the sixtieth day after the notification referred to in the preceding paragraph.
