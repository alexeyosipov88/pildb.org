multimodal transport contract has been concluded with the multimodal transport
operator, or any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf the goods
are actually delivered to the multimodal transport operator in relation to the
multimodal transport contract.
6. "Consignee" means the person entitled to take delivery of the goods.
7. "Goods" includes any container, pallet or similar article of transport or

2. The consignor shall indemnify the multimodal transport operator against loss
resulting from inaccuracies in or inadequacies of the particulars referred to

liability under the multimodal transport contract to any person other than the
consignor.
ARTICLE 13 - OTHER DOCUMENTS
----------------------------
The issue of the multimodal transport document does not preclude the issue, if
necessary, of other documents relating to transport or other services involved
in international multimodal transport, in accordance with applicable
international conventions or national law. However, the issue of such other
documents shall not affect the legal character of the multimodal transport
document.
PART III - LIABILITY OF THE MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT OPERATOR
=========================================================
ARTICLE 14- PERIOD OF RESPONSIBILITY

2. For the purpose of this article, the multimodal transport operator is deemed
to be in charge of the goods:
(a) From the time he has taken over the goods from:
(i) The consignor or a person acting on his behalf; or

SERVANTS, AGENTS AND OTHER PERSONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject to article 21, the multimodal transport operator shall be liable for
the acts and omissions of his servants or agents, when any such servant or
agent is acting within the scope of his employment, or of any other person of
whose services he makes use for the performance of the multimodal transport
contract, when such person is acting in the performance of the contract, as if
such acts and omissions were his own.
ARTICLE 16- BASIS OF LIABILITY
------------------------------
1. The multimodal transport operator shall be liable for loss resulting from
loss or damage to the goods, as well as from delay in delivery, if the
occurrence which caused the loss, damage or delay in delivery took place while
the goods were in his charge as defined in article 14, unless the multimodal
transport operator proves that he, his servants or agents or any other person
referred to in article 15 took all measures that could reasonably be required
to avoid the occurrence and its consequences.
2. Delay in delivery occurs when the goods have not been delivered within the
time expressly agreed upon or, in the absence of such agreement, within the
time which it would be reasonable to require of a diligent multimodal transport
operator, having regard to the circumstances of the case.
3. If the goods have not been delivered within 90 consecutive days following
the date of delivery determined according to paragraph 2 of this article, the
claimant may treat the goods as lost.
ARTICLE 17- CONCURRENT CAUSES
-----------------------------
Where fault or neglect on the part of the multimodal transport operator, his
servants or agents or any other person referred to in article 15 combines with
another cause to produce loss, damage or delay in delivery, the multimodal
transport operator shall be liable only to the extent that the loss, damage or
delay in delivery is attributable to such fault or neglect, provided that the
multimodal transport operator proves the part of the loss, damage or delay in
delivery not attributable thereto.
ARTICLE 18- LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
-----------------------------------
1. When the multimodal transport operator is liable for loss resulting from
loss of or damage to the goods according to article 16, his liability shall be
limited to an amount not exceeding 920 units of account per package of other
shipping unit or 2.75 units of account per kilogram of gross weight of the
goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher.
2. For the purpose of calculating which amount is the higher in accordance with
paragraph 1 of this article, the following rules apply:
(a) Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to
consolidate goods, the packages or other shipping units enumerated in the
multimodal transport document as packed in such article of transport are deemed
packages or shipping units. Except as aforesaid, the goods in such article of
transport are deemed one shipping unit.
(b) In cases where the article of transport itself has been lost or damaged,
that article of transport, if no owned or otherwise supplied by the multimodal
transport operator, is considered one separate shipping unit.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, if the
international multimodal transport does not, according to the contract, include
carriage of goods by sea or by inland waterways, the liability of the
multimodal transport operator shall be limited to an amount not exceeding 8.33
units of account per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged.
4. The liability of the multimodal transport operator for loss resulting from
delay in delivery according to the provisions of article 16 shall be limited to
an amount equivalent to two and a half times the freight payable for the goods
delayed, but not exceeding the total freight payable under the multimodal
transport contract.
5. The aggregate liability of the multimodal transport operator, under
paragraphs 1 and 4 or paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, shall not exceed the
limit of liability for total loss of the goods as determined by paragraph 1 or
3 of this article.
6. By agreement between the multimodal transport operator and the consignor,
limits of liability exceeding those provided for in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of
this article may be fixed in the multimodal transport document.
7. "Unit of account" means the unit of account mentioned in article 31.
ARTICLE 19- LOCALISED DAMAGE
----------------------------
When the loss of or damage to the goods occurred during one particular of the
multimodal transport, in respect of which an applicable international
convention or mandatory national law provides a higher limit of liability than
the limit that would follow from application of paragraphs 1 to 3 of article
18, then the limit of the multimodal transport operator''s liability for such
loss or damage shall be determined by reference to the provisions of such
convention or mandatory national law.
ARTICLE 20 - NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY
--------------------------------------
1. The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention shall
apply in any action against the multimodal transport operator in respect of
loss resulting from loss of or damage to the goods, as well as from delay in
delivery, whether the action be founded in contract, in tort or otherwise.
2. If an action in respect of loss resulting from loss of or damage to the
goods or from delay in delivery is brought against the servant or agent of the
multimodal transport operator, if such servant or agent proves that he acted
within the scope of his employment, or against any other person of whose
services he makes use for the performance of the multimodal transport contract,
if such other person proves that he acted within the performance of the
contract, the servant or agent of such other person shall be entitled to avail
himself of the defences and limits of liability which the multimodal transport
operator is entitled to invoke under this Convention.
3. Except as provided in article 21, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable
from the multimodal transport operator and from a servant or agent or any other
person of whose services he makes use for the performance of the multimodal
transport contract shall not exceed the limits of liability provided for in
this Convention.
ARTICLE 21 - LOSS OF THE RIGHT TO LIMIT LIABILITY
-------------------------------------------------
1. The multimodal transport operator is not entitled to the benefit of the
limitation of liability provided for in this Convention if it is proved that
the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of the
multimodal transport operator done with the intent to cause such loss, damage
or delay or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss, damage or delay would
probably result.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of article 20, a servant or agent of the
multimodal transport operator or other person of whose services he makes use
for the performance of the multimodal transport contract is not entitled to the
benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention if it is
proved that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or
omission of such servant, agent or other person, done with the intent to cause
such loss, damage or delay or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss,
damage or delay would probably result.
PART IV - LIABILITY OF THE CONSIGNOR
====================================
ARTICLE 22 - GENERAL RULE
-------------------------
The consignor shall be liable for loss sustained by the multimodal transport
operator if such loss is caused by the fault or neglect of the consignor, or
his servants or agents when such servants or agents are acting within the scope
of their employment. Any servant or agent of the consignor shall be liable for
such loss if the loss is caused by fault or neglect on his part.

operator or any person acting on his behalf, the consignor shall inform him of
the dangerous character of the goods and, if necessary, the precautions to be
taken. If the consignor fails to do so and the multimodal transport operator
does not otherwise have knowledge of their dangerous character:
(a) The consignor shall be liable to the multimodal transport operator for all
loss resulting from the shipment of such goods; and
(b) The goods may at any time be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as
the circumstances may require, without payment of compensation.
3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of this article may not be invoked by any
person if during the multimodal transport he has taken the goods in his charge
with knowledge of their dangerous character.
4. If, in cases where the provisions of paragraph 2 (b) of this article do not
apply or may not be invoked, dangerous goods become an actual danger to life or
property, they may be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as the
circumstances may require, without payment of compensation except where there
is an obligation to contribute in general average or where the multimodal
transport operator is liable in accordance with the provisions of article 16.
PART V - CLAIMS AND ACTIONS
===========================
ARTICLE 24 - NOTICE OF LOSS, DAMAGE OR DELAY
--------------------------------------------
1. Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of such loss
or damage, is given in writing by the consignee to the multimodal transport
operator not later than the working day after the day when the goods were
handed over to the consignee, such handing over is prima facie evidence of the
delivery by the multimodal transport operator of the goods as described in the
multimodal transport document.
2. Where the loss or damage is not apparent, the provisions of paragraph 1 of
this article apply correspondingly if notice in writing is not given within six
consecutive days after the day when the goods were handed over to the
consignee.
3. If the state of the goods at the time they were handed over to the consignee
has been the subject of a joint survey or inspection by the parties or their
authorised representatives at the place of delivery, notice in writing need not
be given of loss or damage ascertained during such survey or inspection.
4. In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the multimodal
transport operator and the consignee shall give all reasonable facilities to
each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.
5. No compensation shall be payable for loss resulting from delay in delivery
unless notice has been given in writing to the multimodal transport operator
within 60 consecutive days after the day when the goods were delivered by
handing over to the consignee or when the consignee has been notified that the
goods have been delivered in accordance with paragraph 2 (b) (ii) or (iii) of
article 14.
6. Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of the loss
or damage, is given in writing by the multimodal transport operator to the
consignor not later than 90 consecutive days after the occurrence of such loss
or damage or after the delivery of the goods in accordance with paragraph 2 (b)
of article 14, whichever is later, the failure to give such notice is prima
facie evidence that the multimodal transport operator has sustained no loss or
damage due to the fault or neglect of the consignor, his servants or agents.
7. If any of the notice periods provided for in paragraphs 2,5 and 6 of this
article terminates on a day which is not a working day at the place of
delivery, such period shall be extended until the next working day.
8. For the purpose of this article, notice given to a person acting on the
multimodal transport operator''s behalf, including any person of whose services
he makes use at the place of delivery, or to a person acting on the consignor''s
behalf, shall be deemed to have been given to the multimodal transport
operator, or to the consignor, respectively.
ARTICLE 25 - LIMITATION OF ACTIONS
----------------------------------
1. Any action relating to international multimodal transport under this
Convention shall be time-barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not

writing, stating the nature and main particulars of the claim, has not been
given within six months after the day when the goods were delivered or, where
the goods have not been delivered, after the day on which they should have been
delivered, the action shall be time-barred at the expiry of this period.
2. The limitation period commences on the day after the day on which the
multimodal transport operator has delivered the goods or part thereof or, where
the goods have not been delivered, on the day after the last day on which the
goods should have been delivered.

of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration in writing to the
claimant. This period may be further extended by another declaration or
declarations.

are not to the contrary, a recourse action for indemnity by a person held
liable under this Convention may be instituted even after the expiration of the
limitation period provided for in the preceding paragraphs if instituted within
the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted;
however, the time allowed shall not be less than 90 days commencing from the
day when the person instituting such action for indemnity has settled the claim
or has been served with process in the action against himself.
ARTICLE 26 - JURISDICTION
-------------------------
1. In judicial proceedings relating to international multimodal transport under
this Convention, the plaintiff, at his option, may institute an action in a
court which, according to the law of the State where the court is situated, is
competent and within the jurisdiction of which is situated one of the following
places:
(a) The principal place of business or, in the absence thereof, the habitual
residence of the defendant; or

action shall be instituted between the same parties on the same grounds unless
the judgement in the first action is not enforceable in the country in which
the new proceedings are instituted;
(b) For the purposes of this article neither the institution of measures to
obtain enforcement of a judgement nor the removal of an action to a different
court within the same country shall be considered as the starting of a new
action

PART VI - SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS
==================================
ARTICLE 28 - CONTRACTUAL STIPULATIONS
-------------------------------------
1. Any stipulation in a multimodal transport contract or multimodal transport

required in order to give the claimant compensation in accordance with the
provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to the goods as well as
for delay in delivery. The multimodal transport operator must, in addition, pay
compensation for costs incurred by the claimant for the purpose of exercising
his right, provided that costs incurred in the action where the foregoing
provision is invoked are to be determined in accordance with the law of the
State where proceedings are instituted.

The conversion of the amount referred to in paragraph 2 of this article into
national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.
4. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this
article and the conversion referred to in paragraph 3 of this article shall be
made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting
State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in article 18 as
is expressed there in units of account.
5. Contracting States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of
calculation pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this article, or
the result of the conversion pursuant to paragraph 3 of this article, as the
case may be, at the time of signature or when depositing their instruments of
