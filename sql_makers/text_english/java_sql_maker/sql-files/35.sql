VALUES(35, 'The States signatory to the present Convention,
Aware of the urgent practical need in a large and growing global financial market to provide legal certainty and predictability as to the law applicable to securities that are now commonly held through clearing and settlement systems or other intermediaries,
Conscious of the importance of reducing legal risk, systemic risk and associated costs in relation to cross-border transactions involving securities held with an intermediary so as to facilitate the international flow of capital and access to capital markets,
Desiring to establish common provisions on the law applicable to securities held with an intermediary beneficial to States at all levels of economic development,
Recognising that the "Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach" (or PRIMA) as determined by account agreements with intermediaries provides the necessary legal certainty and predictability,
Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect, and have agreed upon the following provisions -

chapter ii - applicable law
Article 4
Primary rule
(1)  The law applicable to all the issues specified in Article 2(1) is the law in force in the State expressly agreed in the account agreement as the State whose law governs the account agreement or, if the account agreement expressly provides that another law is applicable to all such issues, that other law. The law designated in accordance with this provision applies only if the relevant intermediary has, at the time of the agreement, an office in that State, which -
a)  alone or together with other offices of the relevant intermediary or with other persons acting for the relevant intermediary in that or another State -
i)   effects or monitors entries to securities accounts; 
ii)  administers payments or corporate actions relating to securities held with the intermediary; or 
iii)  is otherwise engaged in a business or other regular activity of maintaining securities accounts; or
b)  is identified by an account number, bank code, or other specific means of identification as maintaining securities accounts in that State.
(2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1) a), an office is not engaged in a business or other regular activity of maintaining securities accounts -
a)  merely because it is a place where the technology supporting the bookkeeping or data processing for securities accounts is located;
b)  merely because it is a place where call centres for communication with account holders are located or operated;
c)  merely because it is a place where the mailing relating to securities accounts is organised or files or archives are located; or
d)  if it engages solely in representational functions or administrative functions, other than those related to the opening or maintenance of securities accounts, and does not have authority to make any binding decision to enter into any account agreement.
(3)  In relation to a disposition by an account holder of securities held with a particular intermediary in favour of that intermediary, whether or not that intermediary maintains a securities account on its own records for which it is the account holder, for the purposes of this Convention -
a)  that intermediary is the relevant intermediary;
b)  the account agreement between the account holder and that intermediary is the relevant account agreement;
c)  the securities account for the purposes of Article 5(2) and (3) is the securities account to which the securities are credited immediately before the disposition.
Article 5
Fall-back rules
(1)  If the applicable law is not determined under Article 4, but it is expressly and unambiguously stated in a written account agreement that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office, the law applicable to all the issues specified in Article 2(1) is the law in force in the State, or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State, in which that office was then located, provided that such office then satisfied the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4(1). In determining whether an account agreement expressly and unambiguously states that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office, none of the following shall be considered -
a)  a provision that notices or other documents shall or may be served on the relevant intermediary at that office;
b)  a provision that legal proceedings shall or may be instituted against the relevant intermediary in a particular State or in a particular territorial unit of a Multi-unit State;
c)  a provision that any statement or other document shall or may be provided by the relevant intermediary from that office;
d)  a provision that any service shall or may be provided by the relevant intermediary from that office;
e)    a provision that any operation or function shall or may be carried on or performed by the relevant intermediary at that office.
(2)  If the applicable law is not determined under paragraph (1), that law is the law in force in the State, or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State, under whose law the relevant intermediary is incorporated or otherwise organised at the time the written account agreement is entered into or, if there is no such agreement, at the time the securities account was opened; if, however, the relevant intermediary is incorporated or otherwise organised under the law of a Multi-unit State and not that of one of its territorial units, the applicable law is the law in force in the territorial unit of that Multi-unit State in which the relevant intermediary has its place of business, or, if the relevant intermediary has more than one place of business, its principal place of business, at the time the written account agreement is entered into or, if there is no such agreement, at the time the securities account was opened.
(3)  If the applicable law is not determined under either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), that law is the law in force in the State, or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State, in which the relevant intermediary has its place of business, or, if the relevant intermediary has more than one place of business, its principal place of business, at the time the written account agreement is entered into or, if there is no such agreement, at the time the securities account was opened.
Article 6
Factors to be disregarded
In determining the applicable law in accordance with this Convention, no account shall be taken of the following factors -
a)  the place where the issuer of the securities is incorporated or otherwise organised or has its statutory seat or registered office, central administration or place or principal place of business;
b)  the places where certificates representing or evidencing securities are located;
c)  the place where a register of holders of securities maintained by or on behalf of the issuer of the securities is located; or
d)  the place where any intermediary other than the relevant intermediary is located.
Article 7
Protection of rights on change of the applicable law
(1)  This Article applies if an account agreement is amended so as to change the applicable law under this Convention.
(2)  In this Article -
a)  "the new law" means the law applicable under this Convention after the change;
b)  "the old law" means the law applicable under this Convention before the change.
(3)  Subject to paragraph (4), the new law governs all the issues specified in Article 2(1).
(4)  Except with respect to a person who has consented to a change of law, the old law continues to govern -
a)  the existence of an interest in securities held with an intermediary arising before the change of law and the perfection of a disposition of those securities made before the change of law;
b)  with respect to an interest in securities held with an intermediary arising before the change of law -
i)    the legal nature and effects of such an interest against the relevant intermediary and any party to a disposition of those securities made before the change of law;
ii)   the legal nature and effects of such an interest against a person who after the change of law attaches the securities;
iii)  the determination of all the issues specified in Article 2(1) with respect to an insolvency administrator in an insolvency proceeding opened after the change of law;
c)  priority as between parties whose interests arose before the change of law.
(5)  Paragraph (4) c) does not preclude the application of the new law to the priority of an interest that arose under the old law but is perfected under the new law.
Article 8
Insolvency
(1)  Notwithstanding the opening of an insolvency proceeding, the law applicable under this Convention governs all the issues specified in Article 2(1) with respect to any event that has occurred before the opening of that insolvency proceeding.
(2)  Nothing in this Convention affects the application of any substantive or procedural insolvency rules, including any rules relating to -
a)  the ranking of categories of claim or the avoidance of a disposition as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors; or
b)  the enforcement of rights after the opening of an insolvency proceeding.
 
chapter iii - general provisions
Article 9
General applicability of the Convention
This Convention applies whether or not the applicable law is that of a Contracting State.
Article 10
Exclusion of choice of law rules (renvoi)
In this Convention, the term "law" means the law in force in a State other than its choice of law rules.
Article 11
Public policy and internationally mandatory rules
(1)  The application of the law determined under this Convention may be refused only if the effects of its application would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the forum.
(2)  This Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum which, irrespective of rules of conflict of laws, must be applied even to international situations.
(3)  This Article does not permit the application of provisions of the law of the forum imposing requirements with respect to perfection or relating to priorities between competing interests, unless the law of the forum is the applicable law under this Convention.
Article 12
Determination of the applicable law for Multi-unit States
(1)  If the account holder and the relevant intermediary have agreed on the law of a specified territorial unit of a Multi-unit State -
a)  the references to "State" in the first sentence of Article 4(1) are to that territorial unit;
b)  the references to "that State" in the second sentence of Article 4(1) are to the Multi-unit State itself.
(2)  In applying this Convention -
a)  the law in force in a territorial unit of a Multi-unit State includes both the law of that unit and, to the extent applicable in that unit, the law of the Multi-unit State itself;
b)  if the law in force in a territorial unit of a Multi-unit State designates the law of another territorial unit of that State to govern perfection by public filing, recording or registration, the law of that other territorial unit governs that issue.
(3)  A Multi-unit State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, make a declaration that if, under Article 5, the applicable law is that of the Multi-unit State or one of its territorial units, the internal choice of law rules in force in that Multi-unit State shall determine whether the substantive rules of law of that Multi-unit State or of a particular territorial unit of that Multi-unit State shall apply. A Multi-unit State that makes such a declaration shall communicate information concerning the content of those internal choice of law rules to the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
(4)  A Multi-unit State may, at any time, make a declaration that if, under Article 4, the applicable law is that of one of its territorial units, the law of that territorial unit applies only if the relevant intermediary has an office within that territorial unit which satisfies the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4(1). Such a declaration shall have no effect on dispositions made before that declaration becomes effective.
Article 13
Uniform interpretation
In the interpretation of this Convention, regard shall be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application.
Article 14
Review of practical operation of the Convention

chapter iv - transition provisions
Article 15
Priority between pre-Convention and post-Convention interests
In a Contracting State, the law applicable under this Convention determines whether a person''s interest in securities held with an intermediary acquired after this Convention entered into force for that State extinguishes or has priority over another person''s interest acquired before this Convention entered into force for that State.
Article 16
Pre-Convention account agreements and securities accounts
(1)  References in this Convention to an account agreement include an account agreement entered into before this Convention entered into force in accordance with Article 19(1). References in this Convention to a securities account include a securities account opened before this Convention entered into force in accordance with Article 19(1).
(2)  Unless an account agreement contains an express reference to this Convention, the courts of a Contracting State shall apply paragraphs (3) and (4) in applying Article 4(1) with respect to account agreements entered into before the entry into force of this Convention for that State in accordance with Article 19. A Contracting State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, make a declaration that its courts shall not apply those paragraphs with respect to account agreements entered into after the entry into force of this Convention in accordance with Article 19(1) but before the entry into force of this Convention for that State in accordance with Article 19(2). If the Contracting State is a Multi-unit State, it may make such a declaration with respect to any of its territorial units.
(3)  Any express terms of an account agreement which would have the effect, under the rules of the State whose law governs that agreement, that the law in force in a particular State, or a territorial unit of a particular Multi-unit State, applies to any of the issues specified in Article 2(1), shall have the effect that such law governs all the issues specified in Article 2(1), provided that the relevant intermediary had, at the time the agreement was entered into, an office in that State which satisfied the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4(1). A Contracting State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, make a declaration that its courts shall not apply this paragraph with respect to an account agreement described in this paragraph in which the parties have expressly agreed that the securities account is maintained in a different State. If the Contracting State is a Multi-unit State, it may make such a declaration with respect to any of its territorial units.
(4)  If the parties to an account agreement, other than an agreement to which paragraph (3) applies, have agreed that the securities account is maintained in a particular State, or a territorial unit of a particular Multi-unit State, the law in force in that State or territorial unit is the law applicable to all the issues specified in Article 2(1), provided that the relevant intermediary had, at the time the agreement was entered into, an office in that State which satisfied the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4(1). Such an agreement may be express or implied from the terms of the contract considered as a whole or from the surrounding circumstances.
